**FADE IN:**


**FROM MIRANDA’S CAMERA:**

INT. JACK’S BEDROOM - MORNING

We’re close on something; too close, it’s blurry and confusing.

We hear the voice of MIRANDA Hodgkins, 24.  It’s meek and sweet, soothing, with the unmistakable sing-song lilt of a french accent.

MIRANDA (O.S.)
Jack.  Jack wake up.

The camera pulls back slightly, revealing

JACK Fisk, 26, anemic, pale, heavily tattooed; kind of hot, actually, in his way.  He’s wrapped in a ratty, stained blanket, mostly asleep.

MIRANDA (O.S.) 
Hello baby.

JACK
What...?

MIRANDA (O.S.)
Tell me you love me.

JACK
What?
(waking up)
Oh, what, get that out of my face-

Jack pushes the camera away, but Miranda flops down next to him, giving another close up.

MIRANDA (O.S.)
No.  Tell me you love me.

JACK
That’s not what we bought that for.

MIRANDA (O.S.)
So.  Do it, it’ll make me happy.

JACK
Okay.
(beat)
I love you.

MIRANDA (O.S.)
It worked.  That made me happy.

INT. JACK’S KITCHEN - SHORTLY THEREAFTER

Jack, shirtless, is making breakfast.  The kitchen is dingy and run down; a low rent house.  Outside, through the window, we can see palm trees; west coast, it must be.

The camera tracks his movements from the kitchen table.

JACK
So are you the new Andrew Detmer?

MIRANDA (O.S.)
Jack that’s horrible.

JACK
I’m just saying.  I don’t know if we need documentation that I suck at making bacon.

MIRANDA (O.S.)
Aw, you don’t suck-

JACK
(burnt by popping grease)
Ah!  SHIT!

Miranda laughs.

INT. JACK’S HOUSE - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

The camera is doing something very weird; it’s extremely close to the dirty carpeting, moving somewhat jerkily, as though tracking something...

But there’s nothing, just carpet.

MIRANDA (O.S.)
You can see- I don’t know if it’s picking it up-
(loudly)
Jack!  Jack!

Jack appears, now dressed for work at some fast food chain, looking nervously down at Miranda behind the camera.

JACK
What’s up?

MIRANDA (O.S.)
Look.

JACK
...I don’t see anything.

MIRANDA (O.S.)
The bugs.

JACK
What bugs?

MIRANDA (O.S.)
There are little red- you see them, the little red spiders.  I can see them on the camera.

There’s a moment of silence, and we look back to Jack.  He’s clearly concerned.

JACK
There’s no bugs, babe.

MIRANDA (O.S.)
You have to look closer, you can-

JACK
Did you take your meds today?

Miranda’s silence speaks volumes.

JACK 
Did you?  Cause you’re not coming out tonight if you didn’t take your meds, you know that right-

The camera abruptly cuts out.

**!CLOSE ON:**

A rumpled polaroid, faded and old, showing a pretty young girl, standing with another girl her age, a sister.  Miranda points to the girl with her finger..

MIRANDA (O.S.)
See, that’s me then...and...

We pull back to reveal we’re in

JACK’S BATHROOM



Equally dingy and punk-rock as the rest of the place.

MIRANDA 
This is me now.

MIRANDA Hodgkins, 24, petite, elfin, almost mouselike with the camera up to her face, looks back at us from the mirror.

This is a person fallen into disrepair.  She clearly was once beautiful, but her hair has gone ratty and tangled, her skin pallid and sallow, black-bagged eyes, skinny and frail.

MIRANDA 
Ugh.  That’s not good.

**CUT:**

Moments later, Miranda is straightening her hair.  She’s talking, but it’s with a weird, almost too fast cadence; the unmistakable babble of a schizophrenic.

MIRANDA 
I figure I can record everything and file it away and then I’ll have it for reference about the bugs or my various projects, the things we’re working on, or the thing in the basement, and we’ll be able to see an all-oneness be established between each different thread of my life-

**CUT:**

Miranda is gently applying eyeliner.

MIRANDA 
Beautiful.  Beautiful movie-star.

It’s...better.  Beautiful movie-star is a stretch.

INT. JACK’S HOUSE - MIRANDA’S EDITING CLOSET

The camera has been set down haphazardly on a table, and we can see Miranda lit only in the blue light from monitors.

From the monitors, we hear a familiar voice.

ANDREW DETMER (ON MONITOR)
There’s this thing called an Apex Predator, and basically what that is is the most powerful predator in an ecosys-

She pauses it.

MIRANDA
You can see here he looks really crazy.

She picks up the camera, filming the screen, where we see Andrew Detmer sitting in the junkyard; she’s on some kind of editing program.

MIRANDA (O.S.) 
Yeah.  This part is important. This part is really important.

INT. JACK’S HOUSE - BASEMENT

We cut in, and see Miranda’s workshop for the first time; it’s INCREDIBLY CLUTTERED, with tools, bits and pieces of technology, heavy machinery and circuit boards...

It looks like some kind of hoarding disorder packrat nightmare.  Miranda sits tinkering with something, blow-torching the side of it, wearing a protective mask.

MIRANDA
(muttering)
There we go.  There we go.

VERY SUDDENLY the object she’s working on  LOUDLY WHIRS AND ROTATES RAPIDLY, causing a clusterfuck of falling objects in the room.

**CUT:**

Miranda now stands near to the camera, holding, with some effort, a giant...whatis that?  She is proudly showing it off, whatever it is.

MIRANDA 
This is number seven, but it’s actually the tenth one I’ve built, there were the three for the prototype...

She presses a button, and the chambers on the long, cylindrical device begin to rotate rapidly with a distinct VRRRM sound.  Miranda, smiling, shouts over the noise.

MIRANDA 
Eight hundred rounds a minute!



Dear god.  It’s a gattling gun.

SLAM TO:

INT. KARAOKE BAR - NIGHT

The music is loud, the lights are colorful.  Jack’s on stage, we’re in the audience.  Jack’s singing “Holiday In Cambodia” by the Dead Kennedys.  Totally killing it.

**CUT:**

Miranda’s on stage; she’s awkward out in front of people, but getting a little bit into it.  “Linger” by the Cranberries.

**CUT:**

More drinks.  Laughing.

EXT. SANTA MONICA PIER - FERRIS WHEEL - NIGHT

Jack sits on the ferris wheel next to Miranda, beyond him a cursory view of the pier, the Pacific Ocean, and Santa Monica at night.

We’re close on Jack, drinking from a brown paper bag.

JACK
I’ve reconsidered my stance on you filming.

MIRANDA (O.S.)
Oh yeah?

JACK
Yeah.  I think it’s a good idea. But you know why you’re doing it, right?

MIRANDA (O.S.)
Because, if we have video of every part of my life, I can show people what’s real and what’s not real and-

JACK
No, haha, okay, no.

MIRANDA (O.S.)
What?



JACK
You’re disassociating.  World’s easier to take when you’re looking at it on a little screen.

**CUT:**

JACK 
But I do think it’s a good idea. It’ll humanize us, after the fact. It’ll show people who we were.

Jack smiles at Miranda behind the camera.

MIRANDA (O.S.)
You look handsome.

JACK
Oh shut up-

**CUT:**

Miranda leans in, filming herself, and on the ferris wheel, they kiss.

INT. JACK’S HOUSE - BASEMENT

The camera’s been set up on a tripod, filming Miranda working on some sort of big, bulky thing of metal, gears and wires; it sort of looks like an arm.

She presses a button and- whoa!- it flexes, almost organically.  She smiles at the camera, pleased with her handiwork, and then her cell phone rings.

**CUT:**

Miranda’s off-screen, talking on the phone.

MIRANDA
How did you get this number?...No, I don’t care.  I DON’T CARE.LEAVE ME ALONE.  I don’t want- I DON’T

WANT TO SEE YOU, LEAVE ME ALONE!
LEAVE ME ALONE!

Miranda hurls the phone off screen, it hits something, and there’s the sudden sound of electric whirring- VRMMM-

MIRANDA 
Oh shit-



Something opens fire in the basement , causing INSTANT ANARCHY, bits of broken machinery flying everywhere, blue light oscilating brightly from something off screen as the camera is tipped over onto its side and-

We see Miranda scrambling to a plug-in generator.

MIRANDA 
Shit shit shit!

She yanks out the plug, and the mayhem ceases just as abruptly as it started.

Miranda, wild-eyed, looks around, and then scrambles over to the camera, turning it off.

INT. JACK’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MORNING

It’s storming outside; we can hear rain spattering against the roof, and the occasional sound of thunder.

Jack’s sitting and watching TV, Miranda hurrying in to film him as he beckons her.

JACK
Is it on?  Do you- okay, good, look.  Look.

MIRANDA (O.S.)
At the TV-

JACK
Yes.  Look.

Miranda gets closer to the television, filming it.  It’s showing some kind of news program.The BROADCASTER is accompanied, as always, by footage and photographs backing up everything she says.

BROADCASTER
Our top story today, another sighting of “The Flying Man,” this time from all the way in the Indonesia, in the Borneo province of Kalimantan.

JACK
C’mon, Matt, where you at now?

We see an interview with a local Indonesian man, out on a bridge.  He speaks, but is spoken over by a translator.



INDONESIAN MAN (TRANSLATOR)
The bridge shook, and started to collapse.  We were all very scared, and then we saw him.  He went very fast.

We see that there’s a huge pile of cars over behind him.

INDONESIAN MAN
He took the cars from the bridge and put them in a big pile.  He was very careful.  He saved many lives.

Back to the reporter, where we see several blurry photographs displayed.

JACK
Really?  The three pictures, again, jesus christ.

BROADCASTER
-the seventh such sighting in nine months since the Seattle Catastrophe.

They cut to show a government press conference, led by

Bruce HANSON, late 40s, his suit a little worn down.  The man is all hard edges; the almost prototypical man in black bad-ass, the faceless hands of the system, calloused and intimidating...

HANSON
At this time the United States Government would like to restate that, while details of what happened in Seattle on the night of February 4th are still unclear, there is a prioritized ongoing investigation by both Homeland Security and the Central Intelligence agency-

JACK
This guy!  Look at him, lying, this is him, this is one of the guys!

MIRANDA
Jack, calm down-

JACK
They’re protecting him, always, why?WHY? What’d he do to earn this?



BROADCASTER
As always, more on this story as it develops.  Senate Republicans made waves today when-

JACK
You motherf-you-  you-

He rips the TV from the wall, smashing it on the floor, then hurls the remote into the wall, before kicking over the coffee table, dozens of beer bottles shattering on the floor.

MIRANDA (O.S.)
Jack!  Jack stop!

**CUT:**

Jack is sitting on the couch, huffing and puffing; he looks completely over the edge.

JACK
Did you see that?  Two minutes at the start of the show, “oh the government doesn’t know anything let’s move on.”  LET’S MOVE ON.

LET’S LEAVE IT ALONE.  NO, MIRANDA,
it’s BULLSHIT!  They don’t care, NOBODY CARES-

MIRANDA (O.S.)
I know, I just-

JACK
Is your edit done?

MIRANDA (O.S.)
I, almost, there are-

Jack suddenly stands up, advancing on her; it’s not aggressive, but it’s damn sure intimidating, and Miranda has to back up; this frames her, holding in the camera, in a mirror.

She looks small and helpless in the wake of Jack’s fury.

JACK
Is it done or isn’t it done.

MIRANDA
I- I don’t know- I’m trying, I-

JACK
Is it done?  Is it done?  Is it done-



MIRANDA
Yes, yes it's done, it’s done, I’ll stop filming I just-

JACK
Then we upload it.  Tonight, we upload it tonight.

Jack snatches the camera away from her, filming himself.

JACK 
You people are gonna see.  You people are gonna know. I’m going to show you everything.

DIGITAL
DISTORTION CRASH TO BLACK.

FROM AIELLO’s CAMERA.

EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

It’s pouring down rain.  Currently we’re in a car, driving up to a clearing, lit only by headlights.  For a moment, the camera shows

Mike AIELLO, a young CIA agent with a round, friendly face, before it’s spun around and raised to reveal...

Hanson.  Yep, the guy from TV.  He’s driving, clearly deep in thought.

HANSON
You keep it on no matter what.  You don’t engage, you let me talk.

AIELLO
You talked to him before, right?

HANSON
Once or twice.  It’s okay to be nervous, but he’s just a kid.  You don’t put him on a pedestal, you don’t defer to him on anything. We’re in the middle of a massive security breach, can I trust you to keep it together?

AIELLO
Yes sir.

**MOMENTS LATER.**



The car is pulled over, Hanson getting out, Aiello following. There’s lightning and thunder in the skies, echoing through the trees.

Hanson nods to Aiello to back up, and he does.  Hanson raises and fires a flare gun; the camera follows the flare up into the stormy night sky, then comes back down to Hanson.

Hanson waits, and then lights a cigarette, and smokes, fidgeting.

AIELLO
Did he say he’d be here?

Hanson just looks at him.

AIELLO
I mean, are you sure we can trust him?

Hanson chuckles to himself, and smokes, when-

SONIC BOOM trees shake and Aiello, startled,  falls to the ground!  The car alarm of the parked government sedan is blaring in the night, and then we hear it clicked off.

Hanson, who didn’t move a muscle, reaches down and pulls Aiello up, revealing...

MATT Garretty, 20.  This isn’t quite the Matt we last saw in Tibet, but it’s not exactly someone new either.  He has an anxiousness to him; a vulnerability that’s clumsily hidden behind a veneer of confidence that it seems almost arbitrary that the world’s only “superhuman” would have.

He wears travel clothes.  He’s wet from the rain.  His hair is long.  He almost looks...homeless?

He seems to recognize Hanson.

MATT
You’re Hanson, right?

HANSON
That’s right.

He notices Aiello and reacts immediately.

MATT
What the hell is that, turn that off-

HANSON
That’s Agent Michael Aiello-



MATT
Tell him to stop filming, you, put it away-

HANSON
I’m sorry Matthew but-

MATT
Don’t “Matthew” me turn that off-

HANSON
Our program mandates we have digital record of every official interaction with you.  This is for your safety as well as ours, okay?

Matt groans in a display of authentic teen frustration.

MATT
Look, if you think I won’t just leave, you’re wrong, okay-

HANSON
We need to talk.  Can you come with us please?

MATT
Is it my parents?

HANSON
If you’ll just come with us-

MATT
Well I told you not to contact me unless it was an emergency or if something was up with my parents, so-

HANSON
This is an emergency.

MATT
Yeah well what kind of emergency?

HANSON
It’ll be better if you see it for yourself.

**CLOSE ON:**

A laptop.  On the screen, we see at first only darkness, but then a lens cap is removed, revealing  Andrew Detmer, filming himself in the door mirror of his room in Seattle.



My god. It’s CHRONICLE.

We pull out a little, revealing...

Matt hunched over in a chair, watching the lap-top.

MATT
What is this?

HANSON
Just watch.

INT. EMPTY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The room itself is small and featureless; clean white lighting.There are several nameless government agents standing around, watching Matt, clearly nervous, as...

Matt sits watching the laptop, which has been set up on a desk.  Behind him stands Hanson; he  looks on at Matt with what, even at only a glance, we can instantly recognize as genuine concern.

**CUT:**

Matt is watching himself sing “Price Tag” on screen.

**CUT:**

The baseball test is happening; Matt seems almost hypnotized.

**CUT:**

Steve’s in the storm.  Lightning crashing all around him. Matt is chewing his own hand; he looks almost childlike.

The lightning flashes, and Matt reaches out, slamming closed the laptop.

**CUT:**

It’s moments later; Matt is pacing and crying at the other side of the room, talking to Hanson, who seems to be compelling him to watch the rest of it.

Matt takes a beat and then nods.

**CUT:**

Matt is sitting and watching again, his face one of barely muted agony.



On the screen, Andrew declares himself an Apex Predator. Aiello gets a little too close, a little too personal, and Matt notices.

MATT
(direct to camera)
Get that out of my face.  Now. Now.  Get it out of my face, and turn it off-

**CUT:**

Matt is up, and clearly very upset, trying to keep it together and be “an adult” as he goes back and forth with Hanson.

HANSON
It went up at 2 AM pacific time on an untraceable URL.  Current estimates put it at seven hundred million downloads, getting higher every minute-

MATT
How the hell is this possible?  I thought you had all the footage, that you confiscated all the cameras-

HANSON
And we did. They must’ve hacked our servers.  All of the Haven Hills Project footage is circulated on the same hard drives, we didn’t-

MATT
I’m sorry, “hacked your servers?” What is this, 1994?-I thought this stuff was supposed to be protected-

HANSON
Whoever did it is good, Matt, very very good at what they do, we-

Matt notices the camera filming him.

MATT
I told you to turn that off!

The camera suddenly crunches, the lens cracking-

**CRASH TO BLACK.**

**FROM MIRANDA’S CAMERA:**



EXT. DESERT - MORNING - IN JACK’S TRUCK

At first, just a view of the desert of the American southwest, blowing by at fifty miles an hour.

We can hear “Walking On Broken Glass” by Annie Lennox chugging away on a car radio, over the wind.

The camera pulls back, revealing we’re filming from a passenger seat, Jack driving.  He notices the camera.

JACK
Annie Lennox.  Killin’ it.

He smiles at the camera, and does a gun-click wink.

We can hear Miranda laugh.

**CUT:**

They’re parked outside a desert gas station.  Miranda is filming Jack get back into the car.

JACK 
I brought you a root beer-oh my god what was that, what did you just do?

MIRANDA (O.S.)
...It was my root beer dance-

JACK
Gimme that-

Jack struggles away the camera.

**CUT:**

Miranda, in desert gear, is uncontrollably giggling in the passenger side, unable to perform her root beer dance for the camera.

**CUT:**

JACK (O.S.) 
Come on.  Straight face.

Miranda gets her shit together.

MIRANDA
Okay.  Okay. (in a high voice, doing a little dance) ROooOooOOOtbURRHHHH-

Miranda loses her shit completely.

**CUT:**

We’re in a tight close up on Miranda, who’s out of breath, sobbing with laughter.

JACK
Oh my god, are you- you’re crying?

Miranda nods, choked, unable to muster a response.

JACK 
This woman, she loves root beer.

EXT. THE FLATS - DAY - LATER

The truck is parked, and Miranda is following Jack around to the back of it; it’s big.

JACK
Did you bring enough clozapine for the whole trip-

MIRANDA (O.S.)
Yes, of course.  Don’t talk about that.

JACK
Who are you so afraid is gonna see this anywa- whoa, jesus.

Jack’s looking out at the magnificent expanse of flat desert ahead of him.  There’s junk here and there; wrecked cars, refrigerators, a bus or two, even an old rickety plane.

A desert dumping ground.

JACK 
Aw, Mimi this is perfect.  How’d you find this again?

MIRANDA (O.S.)
They used to take me out here when I was little...

JACK
To do what, exactly?

Jack just looks at the camera.

JACK 
You don’t wanna talk about it. Okay.  Never do.

He opens up the back of the truck.

JACK 
Let’s get this party started.

HARD CUT TO:

The camera has been placed on a tripod.  It now shows a single car, old and rusty.

JACK (O.S.) 
We clear?

MIRANDA (O.S.)
Clear.

There’s that sound again, that distinctive VRRRMMMMMM-

Three streams of blue tracer rounds, beamlike, explode in from offscreen!

The car is reduced to fragmented dust in SECONDS.

JACK
WHOA HOLD FIRE HOLD FIRE!

The dust settles.  There’s nearly nothing left.

JACK (O.S.) 
Miranda...HOLY SHIT.

Miranda cackles happily at Jack’s proclamation.  The fragmented wreckage of the car is burning.

JACK 
IT’S ON FIRE.
(beat)
...shit!

HARD CUT TO:

The camera is in a new location, still on a tripod.  It now shows an ancient, worn down school bus.

MIRANDA (O.S.)
Do you have your headphones on?

JACK (O.S.)
What?

MIRANDA (O.S.)
Haha, okay.  Clear.

There’s an awful, tinny, ear scratching whine, and we can actually seethe thumping wave of sound  flow in from somewhere off-screen.

It suddenly DROPS DOWN INTO DEEP BASS, then SCREECHES BACK UP: every window on the bus shatters, the whole thing shaking violently.

After a moment, the incredible sonic weapon, whatever it was, ceases function.

Miranda creeps in from off-screen, wearing big headphones. She goes over to the bus, and pokes at it-

The entire side of the bus drops off, and Miranda shrieks! We can hear Jack laughing.

MIRANDA 
(beaming)
It works!

HARD CUT TO:

There’s some kind of thing set up in the sand; it looks like an old hemi-engine, with a small microwave satellite dish attached to it, and a long copper rod sticking up out of the back.

This is the Lightning Bug.

JACK (O.S.)
Lightning Bug test going...slowly.

Some sparks shoot out of it.

MIRANDA (O.S.)
Goddamn it.

**CUT:**

Miranda is futzing with it,  sautering something, and tightening bolts.  Jack walks out into frame, kneels down and gives her a little backrub.

**CUT:**

They’re off camera again.

MIRANDA (O.S.) 
Okay, here we go.  Clear!

Nothing.

MIRANDA (O.S.) 
Aw, stupid stupid.

Jack comes out into frame, headed towards the Lightning Bug.

JACK
I’ll go check if the-

The Lightning Bug activates; the little radar dish turns and points towards Jack.

JACK 
Whoa whoa-

-and BLASTS JACK WITH A SMALL BOLT OF LIGHTNING that sends him flying backwards!

MIRANDA
JACK!

**CUT:**

The camera’s off the tripod, Miranda behind it, filming Jack, who’s sitting on the ground, his hair on end, looking frazzled.

JACK
-done, okay?  Yeah, we’re done for the day.  I’m done for the...week.

MIRANDA (O.S.)
Are you okay?

JACK
Well...itworks.

After a moment, Jack starts laughing.  Miranda starts laughing too.

**CUT:**

Jack’s up and by the Lightning Bug, smiling at it, drinking a beer, thinking; he’s already talking.

JACK 
-isperfect.  I figure we pin him down with the sonics, and then, bampowzap, we Steve him.  Ha!

The camera falters.

JACK 
What?  What’s-

**CUT:**

Jack now holds the camera, following a crying Miranda around the side of the truck.

MIRANDA
Why are you filming, STOP IT!

JACK (O.S.)
I want you to remember this moment.

MIRANDA
What!?  WHY!?

Miranda whirls around, actually confronting Jack’s camera. When she’s like this, there’s something slightly dangerous about her.

But only slightly.  For now.

MIRANDA 
That was an awful thing, you shouldn’t have said that.  Steve was a- he was a nice person, he was trying to help-

JACK (O.S.)
I know, I know, you’re right, you’re right.

Miranda seems about to say more, but then falters, looking out into the desert, frustrated.

JACK (O.S.) 
What’s this really about?

MIRANDA
I just- I worry that maybe I haven’t- been thinking clearly, or I- Jack, I don’t know, I just feel like- I don’t want to hurt people.

She squeaks these last words out, almost afraid to say them. Jack goes to her, but he stays behind the camera for a reason.

Just watching the shift in expression on her face tells the whole story.

JACK  (O.S.)
Hurt people?- Miranda- People have already BEEN hurt.  We can’t let our emotions get caught up in this, this is about justice, this is about not letting power blind us to our responsiblities to our fellow man.  We have to kill him, you know that.

Miranda nods soberly.

JACK
And if people get hurt, then people get hurt, that's okay, we can accept that.  Even if we get hurt, we’d be martyred for a good cause. We're the good guys, not him. We're the heroes.

MIRANDA
(quietly)
I...

JACK (O.S.)
Do you trust me?

MIRANDA
(calmer)
Yes.

JACK (O.S.)
I’m sorry.  That was a terrible, insensitive thing of me to say.

MIRANDA
Thank you.
(beat)
You want to try the magnets?

EXT. THE FLATS - LATE AFTERNOON

The reveal is so casual that it’s almost startling:

The Martyr Suit Prototype stands roughly eight feet tall; it’s not of a piece, with many different colors and shapes of the hundreds of different components it’s been cobbled together from.

It looks distinctly rickety and do-it-yourself, and it’s clearly just a skeletal prototype, but they’re no arguing that we are looking at a nearly ten foot tall suit of ROBOT ARMOR.



JACK
This is...insane, Mimi.

Two of the miniguns are mounted on stalks beneath the arms; the Lightning Bug is hooked to the back, and what look like turbo-bass’s are hooked into the clawed “hands.”

It’s some science fiction fever dream made real.  An impossibly beautiful and delicate machine, crafted by the one mind on earth capable of building it.

Jack, fully visible inside of it, looks gleeful as he talks down to Miranda, who’s behind the camera, bouncing around in the suit like a boxer; it moves easily and gracefully.

WE CUT BETWEEN

Miranda’s camera and

THE MARTYR PROTOYPE’S CAMERA

Which is mounted on the chest.

JACK 
How’s this?  Like this?

Jack starts doing the robot, and Miranda laughs.

**CUT:**

Jack has put on a motorcycle helmet.  He looks awesome.

MIRANDA (O.S.)
Okay.  Electromagnetic flight, full-suit Martyr prototype, test one.

Jack nods.

JACK
Okay, I do it?  I just...Ijust do it?

MIRANDA (O.S.)
Yes.

JACK
Okay.

Jack takes a couple deep breaths, and then activates something inside the suit.  There’s a loud “Mmnmnmnmnmnmn” noise and he RAPIDLY FLOATS UP INTO THE AIR-

Whoa way too rapidly, Miranda is forced to chase after him like an untethered balloon.

MIRANDA
Jack!  JACK USE THE STABILIZERS! JACK!

The suit is now just a speck in the air.  On the Martyr suit cams, we can see Miranda waaaaaydown below, frantically waving her arms.

JACK (O.S.)
Well.  Flying...sucks.

**CUT:**

It’s a few minutes later.  Miranda’s filming up from the ground, searching the dusky sky,

MIRANDA (O.S.)
JACK!  Oh jesus-JACK!  JACK!

A little point of light appears on the horizon; two reds and a green.

MIRANDA (O.S.) 
Jack?

The Martyr suit comes SCREAMING IN AT NINETY MILES AN HOUR, ZIPPING PAST MIRANDA BEFORE TWIRLING BEAUTIFULLY UP INTO A LOOP!

MIRANDA (O.S.) 
JACK!  YES!  YES!

It comes back and does another close pass, before SMASHING INTO THE SAND.

MIRANDA (O.S.) 
OH SHIT-

**CUT:**

Jack is holding the camera, dirty with sand, filming himself as Miranda finishes stitching up a cut on his forehead.

JACK
(indicates cut)
Now this...thisis punk rock.

Miranda coos disdainfully.

**CUT:**

The sun hangs low in the sky.



The prototype Martyr suit has been set up next to a campfire.   \* Jack sits nearby, clearly deep in thought, looking very sad.

MIRANDA
What are you thinking about?
(beat)
Are you thinking about Terry?

JACK
Yeah.

MIRANDA
What are you thinking about him?

JACK
...The last time we talked.  You know, he called me.
(emotional)
He called me that night.  He said “Jack, turn on TV, you’ve got to see this.  They’re flying.”  And he sounded so excited, I remember...AndI could hear the helicopter, you know...
(beat)
My whole life, he was the good brother, you know.

MIRANDA
You’re good-

JACK
No, I’m- he had goals, he was married, he had a life, I’m just...someguy, I’m a piece of shit.
(beat)
He wasn’t a cop.  He was just a helicopter pilot, he didn’t do anything to Andrew Detmer.  And he- hejust-
(Jack’s overcome, crying)
He just killed him like it was nothing.  Like it was nothing, like he was a bug-

Jack’s crying, overcome, and Miranda moves to comfort him, but he backs her off.

JACK
Twenty six people died and people don’t care.
They just see the flying guy and they see- they forget and the government says forget, forget it doesn’t matter, but it does, IT DOES MATTER.  Someone has to be held accountable for this. Somebody has to...

Jack fully breaks down.

**CUT:**

Jack’s slightly recovered.

JACK
That’s why...Youknow I believe in you, in us.  It’s love, this is...destiny, it’s not a coincidence that we found each other.  For this.  Because we’re going to fix things.  We’re going to set things right.

**SUNSET.**

It’s later.  There’s music playing in the background; the mood is a little lighter.  The camera is picked up form where it’s been set down, and we see Miranda, sitting and working on leg of the MARTYR prototype.

She notices Jack filming, and smiles self consciously.

JACK 
So six months, and like, what two hundred thousand dollars-

MIRANDA
One seventy.

JACK (O.S.)
And you built that.  Pretty good. SORT of impressive.  Six out of ten.

MIRANDA
The big one isn’t done yet, the real one, this is just the prototype- but it’ll be done soon, and-

JACK
You’re amazing.

Miranda falters, and looks at Jack, her face full of love.

JACK (O.S.) 
You’re beautiful.  You’re perfect.
(beat)
I love you.

Miranda smiles, overwhelmed, and hides her face in her hair. Jack sets down the camera, and crawls into frame.

They kiss.  It’s beautiful.

HARD DIGITAL
DISTORTION

INT. JACK’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM

A couple days have passed.

Jack is already talking to Miranda, who’s behind the camera; he’s animated, angry, and the change in tone is extremely jarring.  The TV is on; it’s cracked and distorted from Jack’s last tantrum.

JACK
-and when are we  gonna have another chance like this?

He indicates the TV.

BROADCASTER
-holding his first ever “press conference” to address the grassroots release of “Chronicle,” which now boasts nearly one billion downloads worldwide-

JACK
That’s four hundred miles from here, we’ll never get this opportunity again-

MIRANDA (O.S.)
The suit isn’t ready, it isn’t-

Jack, flustered, walks away, and she follows him as he paces through the house, angrily fidgeting with EVERYTHING.

JACK
We can use the prototype.

MIRANDA (O.S.)
No, Jack, it isn’t strong enough, that would be suicide-



JACK
And what’s wrong with that?

MIRANDA (O.S.)
I won’t let you, you-

JACK
Miranda, you’ve carried me the whole way!  You got the footage, you put it together, you built the weapon.  But now it’s time for me to do my part, I have to-

MIRANDA (O.S.)
No no no, it isn’t ready-

JACK
The prototype is enough!  You’re just afraid!

MIRANDA (O.S.)
I don’t want you to get hurt!  I don’t want anyone to-

JACK
You’re not thinking clearly, okay, this is everything we’ve been working for-

MIRANDA (O.S.)
You won’t, you won’t do it, tell me you won’t-

JACK
Mimi, come on, listen to yourself-

MIRANDA
(losing it)
You won’t you won’t, say you won’t say you won’t do it,say it to the camera, say you won’t leave me-

JACK
(softer)
Hey...Hey, stop...

Jack goes to her, pushing down the camera.  Our world turns upside down as he holds her.

MIRANDA (O.S.)
(sobbing)
Promise me.  Promise me you won’t do it.  Promise me.



JACK (O.S.)
Shh, okay, I promise, shh.  We’ll talk about it.

The camera lingers, and her sobs slowly go quiet.

SUDDEN LOUD

**FROM STEPHANIE’S CAMERA:**

INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Matt sits on the foot of a hotel bed, hands crossed, looking agitated.

A female voice belonging to STEPHANIE Freeman, late 20s, speaks from off camera.

STEPHANIE (O.S.)
How do you feel?

MATT
(beat)
Nervous.  Just crazy...nervous.

**CUT:**

Matt is up and pacing back and forth.

STEPHANIE
They say there’s about forty two thousand people there live, but the streets are completely crowded. They shut down the freeways-

MATT
Is that supposed to help, because that is- opposite of helping me right now.

STEPHANIE
You’ll be great.

MATT
I don’t- I’m not a- stage guy, I- ...God I wish you’d turn that off.



STEPHANIE
You know I can’t.  I can go out though, if you want-

MATT
No, I- just- What’s your name again?  I’m sorry-

STEPHANIE
I’m Stephanie Freeman-

MATT
And you’re like, an agent or a spy or-

STEPHANIE
I’m an agent of the CIA working through Haven Hills, yes.

MATT
Well can you just put it down, so we can have like- a normal conversation?

STEPHANIE
We are having a normal conversation.

MATT
Ha.Right.  “Normal.”

**CUT:**

It’s a close up shot of Matt’s hand.  It’s shaking.

MATT 
See that?  That’s real.  Awwww crap.  SHIIIIIIIT!  Shit.  Okay.

STEPHANIE
This is for the best.  People need to meet the real you.

MATT
“The real me.”  Oh god.  Okay.
(beat)
How are you, are you okay?

Stephanie laughs.

IN A HOTEL
HALLWAY



Matt is walking along, two government agents in front of him, Stephanie following him.

MATT 
Don’t walk behind me like that, that’s weird.

ENTERING ANOTHER
HOTEL ROOM

As they go in to another hotel room, we get a good look at Stephanie in a mirror.  She’s pretty, but not a knockout; definitely smart, fit, and looking like the sharpest knife in the room.

Richard DETMER, early 40s, comes in; he’s cleaner, calmer than the man we remember from Chronicle, and his face lights up upon seeing Matt.

They hug.

DETMER
Hey Matty.

MATT
Hey Uncle Richard.

DETMER
Who’s this?

MATT
That’s Agent Freeman, she’s one of the- government people.

DETMER
What’s with the camera?

MATT
Don’t even bother, they never turn them off.  I break them, they just get new ones.

DETMER
That’s a little intrusive, don’t you think?

**CUT:**

Matt is talking to his Uncle.  Government agents stand off to the side, silent.

MATT
How’re you doing?



DETMER
You know, I’m...trying.  I’m trying.  A couple of your “fans” burnt my goddamn house down.

MATT
I know, I heard.  I’m sorry.

DETMER
Ha...Yeah, well maybe I had it coming, right?

MRS. GARRETTY (O.S.)
Richie that's horrible!

MATT
Mom!

The camera spins to reveal

MRS. Sarah GARRETTY, late 40s, the loud mom type, entering the room, followed closely by

MR.  Kyle GARRETTY, late 40s, the quiet dad type.  Both of them are nervous as Matt goes to them, embracing them.

MR. GARRETTY
God Matt, it’s been months.

MATT
Yeah, I’m sorry dad.

Matt gives him a big hug, and then turns to the camera immediately, childlike expectation in his voice.

MATT 
Is that guy Hanson coming?

STEPHANIE
No, he’s up at Haven Hills.

MATT
Oh that’s- okay.

STEPHANIE
Something wrong?

MATT
No he just- you know, he seemed like he knew what was going on. Like in charge or whatever.



MRS. GARRETTY
They tried to call Casey, and the Montgomerys, but they’re trying to-

MATT
Casey’s not coming?

MRS. GARRETTY
No.

MATT
I- okay.
(glances at camera)
Yeah, okay.

EXT. HOTEL ROOF - DUSK

Stephanie films Matt, who’s on the roof, talking to his parents.  He’s clearly very nervous now.

MRS. GARRETTY
Just remember, you’re still you. They can cheer or yell or whatever they want, but you’re still you, and you’re fine.

MATT
Mom, I know, I know-

MR. GARRETTY
I wish we could be there for you, Matt.
(to camera)
You sure we can’t come, just stay in the back-

STEPHANIE (O.S.)
No, I’m sorry.  We just think it’s better for you to stay out of the public eye-

MR. GARRETTY
No, yeah, of course, of course.

Mrs. Garretty finishes hugging her son.

STEPHANIE (O.S.)
Matt, you know how to get there?

MATT
Come on.



STEPHANIE (O.S.)
You sure you don’t want me to print you out some directions, or-

Matt laughs and flips her the bird, then rockets into the air-

**FROM NEWS CAMERAS, CAMERAS IN THE CROWD:**

EXT. AT & T PARK - MOMENTS LATER

The baseball stadium is absolutely packed with people, who are brimming with excitement.  A stage with a podium and a microphone has been set up on the field.

There’s an electricity in the air here.  Energy is palpable, you can feel the hairs on your arms stand up.

We can overhear chatter and talking from the crowd, and then, all at once-

It’s SHOCKING.People are standing and cheering, screaming their hearts out as Matt drops down from the sky, landing near the podium.

People are LOSING THEIR MINDS.After almost twenty seconds of cheering, Matt approaches the mic, and they go silent.

MATT
Hi.

The ovation is deafening.Matt startles at the sound of it, and then raises a hand in a self-conscious wave.

MATT 
When I was eighteen I- wow, it got quiet.
(beat)
Okay...WhenI was  eighteen, I went to a party.  It actually was kind of a crappy party, which was what makes it all so...funny, I guess. I took my cousin Andrew, because he was a lonely guy, and I ended up hanging out with Steve Montgomery, because he was...awesome...
(laughs, self-conscious)
Look, you already know all this, which is weird, it’s so weird, I feel like-  I don’t know, just totally exposed and-

The mic suddenly crackles loudly, startling the audience and Matt.All of the electronics in the stadium flicker oddly;



the big screen warps and distorts from electromagnetic interference.

Matt looks around, confused.  He touches his nose.  It’s bleeding.  ...Uh-oh.

Matt looks up at something in the sky-

VRRMMMMMM

**STREAMS OF MINIGUN FIRE DECIMATE THE STAGE AND THE FIELD AROUND IT- MATT DISAPPEARS IN AN EXPLOSION OF WRECKAGE AND DUST AS WE TURN TO SEE-**

!OF COURSE-

!THE MARTYR SUIT PROTOTYPE SWOOPS LOW OVER THE BLEACHERS, MINI GUNS BLAZING-

!THE ENTIRE PLACE DEVOLVES INTO ABSOLUTE CHAOS.

Our viewpoints are shifted, and disoriented; no one’s trying to film this; it’s a superpowered set -piece as we’ve never witnessed it before: as viewed by people in the middle, trying to get as far away from the action as possible.

The Martyr Prototype lands loudly in the bleachers behind home-plate, and FIRES THE SONIC WEAPON INTO THE CROWD, clearing a path to the wreckage of the stage-

Which explodes upwards, Matt telekinetically tossing it away, dirty and covered in cuts-

Matt swings an arm at the suit, and it’s BLOWN BACKWARDS-

But twists midair and rockets into the sky-

-and Matt takes off after it, TACKLING IT INTO THE NOSEBLEED SEATS-

Where they crash violently into the structure, ripping up dozens of seats, before Jack FLINGS Matt off him, AGAIN OPENING FIRE WITH THE MACHINE GUNS, shooting THROUGH the panicking crowd-

Matt, thinking fast, telekinetically SHOVES ALL THE PEOPLE AROUND HIM DOWN and then throws up a telekinetic wall, blocking the stream of bullets-

-the sonic weapon turns on and BLOWS HIM BACKWARDS, off the edge of the stadium, along with several bystanders-



-but he simply flies back up, catching all the bystanders and throwing them to safety (WHOA!) before psi-grabbing a dozen of the broken chairs and flinging them at Jack-

Jack opens fire with the miniguns again, but the chairs knock him off balance, and the glowing blue stream of bullets goes off wild into the sky!

**FROM HELICOPTER NEW SCAM:**

We get an aerial view of the pandemonium in the stadium, when THE ERRATIC STREAM OF BULLETS comes within INCHES of slicing the chopper in half!

HELICOPTER PILOT
Shit clear the air, clear the air, get us the hell out of here!

**FROM NEWS CAMERAS, CAMERAS IN THE CROWD:**

Matt blasts Jack backwards with a huge wave of force, but again Jack pirouettes into flight, corkscrewing back around, guns BLAZING-

-jesus that was  beautiful and incredible-

Matt launches off, and we-

-follow them from various tight, intimate vantage points as the two of them crash through the stadium’s different levels, Jack firing off the miniguns and sonic weapons with reckless abandon until-

Matt, spun out by the sonic weapon, crashes into the pitchers mound-

Jack lands right next to him, the Lightning Bug engine, REVVING ON HIS BACK, ELECTRICITY CRACKLING UP THE LIGHTING ROD-

Matt stands-

-grabs the Martyr Prototype by the chest-

-and FLINGS IT TWO HUNDRED FEET UP INTO THE HUGE LIGHT RIG OVER THE FIELD!

The Lightning Bug EXPLODES, malfunctioning wildly, cascading an anarchy of electricity IN ALL DIRECTIONS.  The lights all around Jack pop and BURST in a chaos of light and noise!

Matt, down on the field, looks up at all the anarchy in the stadium, and touches his bleeding, presumably ringing ears. He’s covered in cuts and bruises already.

He staggers, clearly trying to clear his head.

National Guard troops have started to appear, and one of them gets in one of our crowd camera’s face; the situation is being brought under control...ish.

**FROM THE MARTYR PROTOYPE’S CAMERA:**

We can hear Jack struggling, but it’s no good; clearly parts of it were damaged from the fight, and what was left after that has been fried by the explosion of the Lightning Bug.

He’s imbedded in the lighting rig...Butdown below him, on the top of the huge digital Scoreboard display, we can see Miranda, climbing up from an access ladder.

She holds the camera at her side, not filming; she looks wild-eyed and panicked, furious.

JACK (O.S.)
(yelling to her)
I’m sorry baby!  You know it had to be this way!

She screams back at him, but we can barely hear her.  She’s crying, we can see that now; the suit’s camera zooms in to see her.

JACK (O.S.) 
Get that camera out!  This is our moment, this is what we worked for!

Miranda shakes her head violently, yelling at him.

JACK (O.S.) 
Come on, Mimi.  Don’t make me do this alone.

Miranda stares at him for a moment, then slowly raises the camera.

**FROM MIRANDA’S CAMERA:**

We can hear her breathing hard, crying, behind the camera as she pans the chaos in the stadium.

MIRANDA (O.S.)
(muttering)
I told you no.  I told you no.  You promised you promised.  I told you no.

Something flits past, and she follows it.  It’s Matt; he flies up to where Jack’s stuck, getting very close.



MIRANDA 
No.  Stop.  No.

We INTERCUT between THE MARTYR PROTOYPECAM and MIRANDA’S.

Matt, getting his first real look at the Martyr Prototype, is clearly in an even mix of horror and fascination.  He gets close, but a crackle of electricity makes him back off a tiny bit.

When he finally speaks to Jack, it’s in an abstract way; almost as though Jack didn't just try to murder him, injuring and possibly killing dozens of innocent people.

Matt is reacting exactly how you’d react if you were seeing the CRAZY SHIT he's seeing.

MATT
Whhhhhh...whatthe hell  is this? Did you build this, jesus christ man...

The suit struggles, but Matt has it pinned, it’s tangled in the wiring of the lights.

MATT 
Quit trying to fight, you are going nowhere.

MIRANDA (O.S.)
Please stop please stop please stop.

Jack, breathing hard, clearly scared, unleashes his polemic.

JACK (O.S.)
HOW ARE YOU GONNA SAVE THE WORLD, MATT?  You killed your cousin, and then you RAN AWAY!  YOU COULDN’T

EVEN SAVE ANDREW, TELL ME HOW
YOU’RE GONNA SAVE THE WORLD-

MATT
Whoa, hey- just- shut up!  I don’t understand- who are you, what do you want from me?

JACK (O.S.)
You were there.  I’m not going to let you walk away from what happened.  There’s nothing to stop you from becoming what you could become.  There has to be justice for what you did.  I will restore balance to the human race.



MIRANDA
JACK NO!  PLEASE JACK NO! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

This last shriek is loud enough that Matt actually hears it; confused, he turns Miranda, looking down to where she stands far beneath him.

For a moment, they make eye contact, but only Miranda’s camera catches this.

MATT
Who-

Jack takes the opportunity to flip open a little panel and hit a button on the Martyr suit-

-Matt turns and notices a split second before-

ka BOOM !

The explosion is MASSIVE, the wire-frame tower of the light rig coming apart like an erector set!

Matt is blasted out of the airlike a missile, crashing down to the diamond below.

Miranda and her camera are smashed by the shock wave;the camera is dropped, but Miranda is knocked all the way off the top of screens, and we watch from her dropped camera as she has to scramble to hold on to the ledge...

-gonna fall-

No!  Miranda forces herself back up onto the top, immediately collapsing to her knees, hyperventilating.

MIRANDA
N...n...Nononono.  JACK!  JACK! NO!  JACK!  JACK!  NO!  NO!

The words take on a dangerous, broken screech.  She’s making sounds, but they’re not words so much, not anymore.

It should be tragic, but instead...It’s somehow chilling.

Miranda Hodgkins might not have fallen to her death.

But she has gone over the edge.

**CRASH TO BLACK.**

**FROM AIELLO’S CAMERA:**



EXT. AT & T PARK - GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER

Matt, covered in cuts and bruises and dirty, is being looked at by medics, who he keeps shoving away as the camera approaches him, with Stephanie walking out ahead.

MATT
It’s about time, where’s my family?

STEPHANIE
We’re taking them out of the city as we speak-

MATT
Where’s the girl?

STEPHANIE
Girl?- What girl-

MATT
THERE WAS A GIRL, ON THE

SCOREBOARD.  DID YOU NOT SEE HER,
GET THE CAMERAS, she MUST be on the cameras!

AIELLO (O.S.)
Hey, easy, we’ve got it under control-

MATT
Under control, yeah okay- NO, NO YOU DON’T. Hanson’s at Haven Hills?

STEPHANIE
Yes-

MATT
Right.

Matt takes off SONIC BOOM he's gone; people are knocked down by it, dazed, only starting to recover.

STEPHANIE
Shit.

AIELLO (O.S.)
Call Hanson-

STEPHANIE
I know.

Stephanie takes out her cell.



STEPHANIE 
(into cell)
Yeah.  Director, he’s on his way to you now.  About thirty seconds ago.
(to Aiello)
Camera off.

**FROM AN AGENT’S HANDHELD:**

INT. HAVEN HILLS FACILITY - HANSON’S OFFICE

The camera is hurriedly being turned on, first filming the floor, then up to Hanson.  We’re in his office; tasteful, functional, nothing fancy.

News reports from San Francisco play on a big screen on the wall.  Hanson is typing something on his laptop.

HANSON
You got that on?  Good.

From somewhere outside, we can hear a SONIC BOOM and the building rattles.  Hanson sighs, and sits back in his chair, clearly thinking, preparing himself.

HANSON 
(to camera)
Stay calm.

There’s a crashing, shattering sound from somewhere in the building.  Then, after a moment, another one.  Then a third, much closer.

Then VERY SUDDENLY-

The oak door blasts off its hinges, crashing to the ground, and Matt storms through; he paces like a caged animal in front of Hanson’s desk, still covered in bruises, cuts, dust and dirt.

He’s followed, cautiously, by another agent, with another camera.

Matt’s eyes are slightly wild, but he’s keeping it together.

MATT
Okay FIRST OF ALL, first of all, what the hell was that thing?  I do not for a second believe that guy built that alone!  You’re going to find who built it, okay?


You’re going to find out when, and where, and how, and- there was a woman, okay there was a woman I saw- she must still be in the area, GET HER, okay?  And my family, I want my family out of there, as far as possible, and somewhere safe, do you hear me?  HEY ARE YOU LISTENING

TO ME?  DO YOU HEAR ME, DO IT!
NOW!

Matt stands there, breathing hard.

Hanson takes off his glasses, and shuts his laptop, standing. He stares at Matt blankly; there’s no fear in his eyes.  No anything, except...

Faced with the most powerful human being on Earth, Scott Hanson looks....

Annoyed.

HANSON
Who the hell do you think you are?

MATT
...What?

Hanson comes around his desk, speaking in a measured tone.

HANSON
You’re gonna order me around?  In what alternate reality are you living that you think you can walk in here and shout at me?  I am not your employee any more than you are mine, we’ve offered you an official position, you said no-

MATT
Oh come on this again, really, really!?

HANSON
-We’ve offered you protection, so when something like this inevitably happened-

MATT
What so this is my fault, are you stupid, are you an idiot, did you not-

HANSON
HEY.  Being a nice guy who can fly doesn’t give you credence to come in here like Genghis Khan-



**MAT T (CO NT'D)**

MATT
-Did you not see what JUST FREAKING HAPPENED-

HANSON
-knock my goddamn nice oak door off the- sit down.

MATT
-Someone tried to kill me, man! They hurt people, they-

HANSON
-and being  scared does not give you the right to be an asshole. SIT DOWN.

Matt falters; for the first time we really feel the weight of Hanson’s presence.Matt’s still just a kid looking for a home, and Hanson’s complete confidence is enough to stop the rotation of the earth.

They face off like that for a moment before Matt, showing his age loud and clear, begrudgingly pulls out a chair and flops down into it.

MATT
(to camera)
Turn that off.

HANSON
Leave it on.

**CUT:**

The room is full of agents now, taking notes on paper and digital devices.  Cuts on Matt’s forehead, neck and arm are being bandaged by medics, while a sketch artist finishes taking a description.

Hanson, in the meantime, is going a mile a minute to various agents, talking on the phone, and skyping.

HANSON 
Yeah, I want every camera we can get; this is Seattle Protocol, people, pull everything.

The sketch artist finishes his drawing, and holds it up to Matt; it’s a mostly accurate rendering of Miranda.

HANSON 
This her?



MATT
Yeah, that’s...yeah.

HANSON
Okay.

Hanson turns, and rattles out orders with absolute confidence and lightning fast speed as everyone takes notes.  It’s The Fugitive.

HANSON 
Put an APBout to San Francisco  PD on this description, get the picture there too.  Also let’s contact the FBI, see if we can get Jane Doe kicked up to the top of America’s most wanted.  On top of that, let’s hit Interpol, get pings on her globally, plus let’s loop in NSA, CIA, Homeland Security, the whole kit and kaboodle.  Let’s also stick a flag in the remains of the weapon and its pilot, I want those sent here to be looked at by OUR people, see if we can source the parts.  Let’s get this all done in the next fifteen minutes please and thank you, and anyone without an active assignment find one and clear my office.  Geronimo.

The agents depart, hurriedly, as Hanson leans into his intercom.

HANSON 
Pentagon, you got all that?

PENTAGON OFFICER
(on phone)
Got it.

HANSON
Thank you.

Hanson clicks off the phone.  He and Matt are left alone (to the exclusion of the camera and the medics).

HANSON 
How bad are his injuries?

MATT
I’m fine.

HANSON
Uh-huh.  How bad are his injuries?

MEDIC
Mostly superficial, but we’ve got to keep a watch on this cut on his neck.

HANSON
Okay, you mind giving us some space?

The medic nods and heads out.  Hanson sighs, looking at Matt, who’s clearly self conscious about his earlier outburst.

HANSON 
See?  No yelling needed.  We got all hands on deck now.  We told you if you’d cooperate with our operation we’d protect you, and we’re doing our best to do that. Good enough?

MATT
(with a Matt-smirk)
...Yeah, well I’m sorry about your nice oak door.

HANSON
(beat)
You okay?

MATT
(beat)
...No, man.  I don’t know. (leans forward, putting his head in his hands) I don’t know.

HANSON
(to camera)
Give us a minute, would you?

AGENT (O.S.)
Sir?

HANSON
Give us a minute.

!BEAT ON BLACK.

**FROM STEPHANIE’S CAMERA:**



INT. HAVEN HILLS FACILITY - WAITING ROOM AREA

The camera is a safe distance from Matt, who’s asleep, laying on a couch.  He looks uncomfortable, and tired, sort of like a little boy.

Matt stirs, bleary eyed, and notices Stephanie.

MATT
Wow, super creepy.

**CUT:**

Matt is sitting up, tired.

STEPHANIE (O.S.)
You’ve been here all night?

MATT
What time is it?  Seven, oh jesus christ-

**CUT:**

STEPHANIE (O.S.)
Is there anything I can do?

MATT
Where are my parents?

STEPHANIE (O.S.)
They were moved to a safe house just outside of Beale, California. We’ve got Marines on watch around the clock-

MATT
Couldn’t the person who hacked the server just find that out too?

STEPHANIE
We’ve changed all the passwords and firewalls, they’d have to start from scratch.

MATT
Where’s Hanson?

STEPHANIE (O.S.)
He’s downstairs, coordinating all the new footage.

**CUT:**



MATT
How many people did it...kill?

STEPHANIE (O.S.)
(long beat)
Two.  There are a lot of people injured, but only two fatalities. It’s kind of a miracle, really.  We were looking at the footage, you did a great job, protecting people...

Matt isn’t listening.  He’s just staring at the floor, trying to process it; pushing away the darker thoughts.

He snaps out of it.

MATT
Okay...Okay.

INT. BATHROOM

It’s a standard men’s room; harshly lit.  Matt stands in front of the mirror, Stephanie filming him from behind.

He’s peeling back the bandage on his forehead.

MATT
(winces)
Agh, god that stings.

STEPHANIE
You really shouldn’t-

MATT
No, it’s okay.  I’m gonna show you a trick.

He looks at the cut on his neck, and then tears the bandage off in one move.

MATT 
OW!!! MOTHERFU-

**CUT:**

We’re getting a close up of the cut on Matt’s neck.  It’s a bit gruesome.  Matt, for his part, seems to have mentally taken up a place familiar to us, all giggly excitement...

...familiar perhaps, from a toy store, or a backyard, long ago...



MATT 
Alright, you- got it, yeah?

STEPHANIE (O.S.)
Yeah.  What’re you-

MATT
Okay this is one of my new ones, okay...

Matt holds up his hand over the cut, and after a moment, the stitches pop out.

MATT 
Okay wow this hurts.

And then...thecut, now open, pulls together, the skin weaving together and rapidly scabbing over, and then the scab falling away to reveal a perfectly healed scar.

STEPHANIE (O.S.)
Holy shit.

MATT
Riiiiight?  Pretty good.

**CUT:**

STEPHANIE (O.S.)
How long have you been able to do that?

MATT
Couple of months, I figured out how to do it after I got that flu, was that before you were here?

STEPHANIE (O.S.)
I think so.

MATT
I got that flu and I figured if I could visualize me grabbing and crushing every little virus, I could be healthy again.  And it worked.  So then I was like, if I could visualize me stimulating the cells to repair and knit together...andI guess that works too.

Matt smiles, clearly very proud of himself, but also just glad to have someone to talk to.



EXT. HAVEN HILLS FACILITY - DAY

Matt is walking outside the Haven Hills facility; the facility is clearly new, built in the middle of the woods, at the old Haven Hills barn site.

He talks to Stephanie as he walks; the cut on his forehead is a mere scar now, too.

MATT
It’s so weird that you built all this so fast, you know?  I remember, there was just an old barn here...therewas nothing.  Now it’s like, people everywhere, crazy.

STEPHANIE
The program is a priority for national security.

MATT
Oh yeah, I bet.  Is it just me, or do you guys do other stuff, too?

STEPHANIE
That’s classified.

MATT
C’mon.
(beat)
Wasn’t there that big fireball in Iowa a couple months ago?  And that electricity thing up in North Dakota, you guys know anything about that?

STEPHANIE
I’m sorry, that really is classified.

MATT
(a-ha!)
That’s a yes.  That’s a big’ol’yes.

**CUT:**

They’re at the edge of a paved path into the woods.

MATT
(looks to the woods)
...Is it all dug up, back there?



STEPHANIE
Yes.
(beat)
Do you want to go see-

MATT
No.  I...uh...no.  Mogo-he doesn’t want to see me.
(mutters)
I think he’s mad at me.

STEPHANIE
What?

MATT
Nothing, I don’t- nothing.

INT. HAVEN HILLS FACILITY - CAFETERIA

They’re in the Haven Hills facility’s cafeteria; standard government fair, nothing fancy.  Matt is greedily eating the food

MATT
Sometimes I just sleep outside. Well I mean mostly used to sleep in hotels, motels...Iguess that’s done, now that everyone knows my face.

STEPHANIE (O.S.)
Why don’t you just stay with your parents?

MATT
They don’t...y’know, it’s hard. They don’t really get it, I guess? I don’t even know if I get it, really, anymore.

STEPHANIE (O.S.)
Get what?

MATT
Me.  You know...WhoI am.  Who I want to be.  They can’t treat me normal, nobody treats me like a real person...

Matt is distracted by something on one of the mounted TVs. The camera turns to show the TV, which is showing a live report on a massive car pile-up on the freeway.



The camera goes back to Matt, but he’s already getting up.

STEPHANIE
Matt, what’re you- wait, wait-

**CUT:**

Stephanie is chasing Matt up a hallway.

STEPHANIE
Matt, wait for a second, just talk to me-

They reach the elevators, Matt going in to an open one, and Stephanie following him.

STEPHANIE
Listen, I know you want to go out, but Hanson says-

Matt smirks and ducks out of the elevator, making a pinching motion with his fingers that causes the elevator doors to SLAM SHUT!

STEPHANIE
...Shit!

**FROM AIELLO’S CAMERA:**

EXT. HAVEN HILLS FACILITY - SHORTLY THEREAFTER

The camera rushes to catch up with Matt, who’s walking purposefully in the field area around the large government facility building, wooded on all sides.

AIELLO (O.S.)
Mr. Garretty!  Wait, Mr. Garretty!

MATT
Not now Mike, I-

HANSON
Hey!  What the hell?

Hanson rapidly approaches.

MATT
Oh here we go.

HANSON
The hell is the idea trapping Stephanie in the elevator like that?



MATT
There’s a big pile-up on the ten, gasoline fires, I thought-

HANSON
No.  You’re grounded, you’re on break til we figure this out.

MATT
I’m sorry, I’m grounded?

HANSON
It’s for your own safety.

MATT
I don’t take breaks, okay, that isn’t how this works.I made a promise that I would help people, if I see an opportunity to do that and I don’t-

HANSON
The entire world is talking about YOU right now, Matt, nothing else. Those psychos who tried to kill you are most likely waiting for you to show your face, so they can-

MATT
So they can what!?That thing blew up-

HANSON
Who says they don’t have another one, who says they don’t have TEN more?

MATT
So I’m supposed to what, hang around here picking my nose til another robot drops out of the sky and starts blowing crap up?  Screw that, man.

Matt and Hanson come out to an excavation site; the ground has been dug away, exposing the massive front mantel of the crystalline entity from Chronicle!

It’s MUCH bigger than what we saw before, and, free of the chamber around it, it’s debatably clear that what we’re looking at is some kind of face.  Not like any face on any animal we’ve ever seen before but still...

...A face.



Men are down there, doing tests on it, running scans and such.

Neither Matt nor Hanson acknowledge its presence.

HANSON
That’s what terrorism is, Matt, it’s waiting.  It’s accepting that something bigger than you is-

MATT
But it’s not bigger than me, it’s ABOUT me.

HANSON
Listen, YOU’RE not just YOU anymore.  You’re an idea, you’re a- a superher-

MATT
Yeah, well what if I don’t want to be an idea, what then?  Where does what I want come in to it?

Hanson sighs.

HANSON
I’m not FBI, I’m not CIA, I’m not anything anymore.  I’m Haven Hills, and that is a bureau dedicated half to you, and half to...that.

MATT
-Mogo-

HANSON
Whatever you wanna call him, sure. Point is he doesn’t have anyone shooting at him, yeah?

Matt’s listening.

MATT
(beat)
We have transport arranged for you to your parents’ safe house, we figure that where you stay until we have a next step.  Okay?

After a beat, Matt shrugs.

MATT 
Okay.



Hanson eyes him for a moment, clearly questioning his sincerity.

INT. HAVEN HILLS FACILITY - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Matt is exiting a room holding a duffle-bag, walking with a purpose.  Aiello follows him.

EXT. HAVEN HILLS FACILITY - MOMENTS LATER

Matt walks ahead of Aiello.

AIELLO (O.S.)
Where are you going?

MATT
The safe house.

AIELLO (O.S.)
But the bus is the other way-

MATT
I’m making a little detour.  These crazies think they can scare me out of helping people, nope, sorry.
(beat)
I don’t respond well to bullying.

AIELLO (O.S.)
I’m under orders not to leave your side.

MATT
Yeah?
(beat)
Well then hold your breath.

**MATT LAUNCHES INTO THE AIR AND WE’RE DRAGGED RIGHT BEHIND HIM, PAST THE SOUND BARRIER, THE WORLD BLURRING BY, MATT OUT AHEAD, THE LANDSCAPE ZIPPING PAST BENEATH AND THEN-**

EXT. FREEWAY - CONTINUOUS

Matt lands and we suddenly decelerate rapidly and land in a rough roll.

Aiello struggles to his feet, the camera whipping around wildly: we’re right in the middle of the pile up.Cars are crashed and flipped all over the place.



Oil fires burn as firemen struggle to put them out, the jaws of life are being applied to a crumpled car.

Matt starts subtly, casually waving his hands:

The crumpled car UNCRUNCHES, releasing the man trapped in side into the arms of the fire fighters!  The doors of all the flipped or damaged cars rip off and fall to the ground!

And then, lastly, with a careless swoop of his arm, the fires go out!

Matt turns, seeing a newsvanon the scene, and rapidly walks towards it.

AIELLO (O.S.)
Mister Garretty!  Mister Garretty please!

**FROM NEWS CAMERA:**

The REPORTER is stunned and star-struck as Matt brushes right by him, going right up to the camera, grabbing it by the lens and pulling it right up to his face.

MATT
I.  AM NOT.  AFRAID.  OF YOU.

**CRASH TO BLACK.**

**FROM THE WHIRLYBIRD CAMERA:**

INT. JACK’S HOUSE - BASEMENT

For a moment things are out of focus,but then it pulls together.  We’re looking through a slightly fish-eyed lens Jack’s basement, sitting on a workshop table.

Most of the lights are off, but the room is lit in a spooky blue glow by lap-tops and smartphones EVERYWHERE, all interlinked with firewire cables; all the screens are on, with code rapidly scrolling across them, running some kind of program.

Miranda is front and center, tinkering with something behind the camera.  She looks, flatly put, insane.  Her eyes are wide but seem unfocused, she’s tousled and unwashed, and has math equations written ALL OVER her arms.

There’s a buzz, and she smiles, standing up and away from the camera...Which, with a gentle “whirrrr” sound, lifts into the air.



MIRANDA
See Jack?  No hands.

**CUT:**

Whatever the camera is riding on follows Miranda, floating roughly six feet in the air, as she picks her way through the basement, now more cluttered than ever, to the stairs.

The manic, hyper-decisive way she speaks is unmistakable.  A schizophrenic slowly coming unglued from our reality.

We get the impression from her delivery that even if there was no camera...she’d be saying all this to herself.

MIRANDA 
It’s done now.  I finished it this morning.  You were right.  We do need to keep filming.  So they can know who we were.  That we weren’t the bad guys.  That it was him.  It was him.

**CUT:**

Miranda is walking up the stairs, and in the light we can see that she’s written all over the walls.

MIRANDA 
They showed you on TV, you would’ve been so impressed, it’s all anybody is talking about now.  I’ve been very busy, I have to be careful, because they’re watching me now.

**CUT:**

Miranda’s up in the house, which is a mess, things are broken, equations written on the walls in sharpie.

MIRANDA 
I never told you because I knew you’d think I was crazy, but there are people watching me all the time.  Eyes in the sky, in every camera, that’s why I don’t go out.

We get our first look at our new camera when it passes a mirror; it’s a simple, store-bought miniature helicopter, the sort you can download aps to control with your  iPhone, modified by Miranda’s brilliant mind to be her own personal documentarian.



MIRANDA 
There are bugs here, Jack, bugs everywhere.  Now that you’re not here I see that there are little red spiders all over everything.  I think you kept them away, your scent, your pheromones, or a chemical in your blood.  I would take your blood and rub it all over me if it would keep them off, haha, it sounds crazy but I really would.

Miranda looks around the dirty, destroyed living room with genuine concern and fear.

MIRANDA 
This will all have to burn soon.

**CUT:**

Miranda is stalking through the house, carrying a bunch of circuit boards and machinery, when there’s A SUDDEN POUNDING AT THE DOOR.

Miranda drops everything and it crashes to the floor.

LANDLORD (O.S.)
Mr. Fisk!  Mister Jack!  It’s Lupe!

Miranda ducks off screen quickly, the camera trying to track her quick movement but then giving up and hanging in the middle of the room, filming the door.

LANDLORD (O.S.) 
Your rent is two weeks overdue! You need to pay now, please!

Miranda reappears, holding a kitchen knife, staring at the door,trembling with potential energy .

LANDLORD (O.S.) 
I know you’re in there!  Open the door or I’m coming in!  Five. Four.  Three.  Two.  OKAY!  You make me do this.

The key jangles in the lock, and Miranda raises the knife higher.  The knob turns.  The door opens-

-but catches on the chain.  Daylight floods in, and an arm comes through, reaching around trying to undo the chain.

Miranda rapidly stalks towards the arm, getting ready to stab it, the whirlybird following her (oh shit oh shit), but then stops, waiting-

The arm, unsuccessful at undoing the chain, retracts to from whence it came, the door slamming closed.

LANDLORD (O.S.) 
I’ll be back.  You got two days, I’m coming back with la policia!

We can hear the landlord depart.  Miranda turns and stares back at the camera, and gives a weird, flinching smile.

**CUT:**

Miranda is hurrying through the hallway, taking off her shirt.  As she enters the bedroom, she slams the door; the Whirlybird bumps into it.

**CUT:**

Miranda suddenly bursts out of the bedroom, and the whirlybird banks hard to follow her movement; she’s now wearing a tight tank-top and yoga pants, stripped down.

A flight suit.

**CUT:**

Miranda heads to the basement talking back to the camera as she goes.  There’s a sense of sober, contemplative reason in her voice, that mixes strangely with the lunacy and squalor around her.

MIRANDA
When a caterpillar is born, it’s one hundred percent caterpillar, every cell in the body is of a whole, doing the same things, operating the same way.  But then, one day, one of the cells changes: the illuminated cell.

**CUT:**

She’s further down the stairs, heading into the darkness. From downstairs, we can hear something powering up.

MIRANDA 
It can come from anywhere, the eye, a leg, the heart.
But the illuminated cell begins to spread the word to all the other cells that it’s time to change, and they do.  That one cell sends a message to millions of others, it changes them and makes them beautiful!

**CUT:**

Miranda’s down in the darkness now, lit by the glow of all the laptops.  On a screen behind her, we can see Matt’s “I AM NOT AFRAID OF YOU” playing on loop, muted.

MIRANDA 
That was you Jack, you changed my life.  I was lost, and I was alone, and I thought that was all I could be.  But you found me.  And you loved me.  And you gave me a purpose.

The computers let out a greek chorus of confirmation “beeps” and “dings.”  Suddenly all of the screens show a geographical location, a marker from a satellite photograph.

MIRANDA 
And now I’m part of something bigger than myself.  I’m going to change the world.  I understand now, I understand what you said about us being martyrs.

Miranda presses a small button, like a car-key, and the full Martyr suit, now completed, activates behind her in the darkness: a hulking, formless shape.

We can see the three lights, two green and one red, turn on, as well as two bright headlights, that reduce Miranda to a strange, ghostly silhouette.

MIRANDA 
I am an illuminated cell.

!DIGITAL CUT.

**FROM AIELLO’S CAMERA:**

INT. SAFEHOUSE - DINING ROOM

Matt and his parents are having dinner.  Aiello’s at the table with them.  Matt’s dad is addressing the camera.

Matt looks despondent, Matt’s mom just concerned.

MR. GARRETTY
Yes but you don’t really have to film us eating.

AIELLO (O.S.)
I’m under orders to document everything.

MATT
They do it cause they think I’m gonna do a  scooby-dooand take off my human skin.

MR. GARRETTY
That’s not true, is it?

AIELLO (O.S.)
Well-

MR. GARRETTY
Matt, is that true, do you feel like...analien?

Matt just stares at his father, then directly at the camera.

“Come the fuck on.”

**FROM STEPHANIE’S CAMERA:**

EXT. SAFEHOUSE - SUNSET - LATER

We’re on the ground in the clearing around the house, a nice colonial in the middle of the woods.

Matt sits on the roof, holding a baseball, staring at it.

STEPHANIE (O.S.)
Hey hot shot.

Matt laughs at her approach.

MATT
Hey.

**CUT:**

Stephanie is clambering up onto the roof.

**CUT:**

Stephanie comes and sits down next to Matt.



STEPHANIE (O.S.)
Hanson’s pretty pissed at you.

MATT
(smiling)
See, this is why I never wanted to go to you guys, the government or whatever.  I didn’t want to be in a position where people were like, yelling at me and shit.
(beat)
Where are the guards, soldiers and stuff?

STEPHANIE
They’re here.  If you could see them they wouldn’t be very good at their job, right-

Matt telekinetically sucks the camera away from her, so we’re now filming Stephanie.

STEPHANIE 
HEY!

MATT (O.S.)
Why did you take this job?

STEPHANIE
Matt, give me that back, I will get fired-

MATT (O.S.)
Why'd you take the job?

Stephanie’s quiet for a beat.

STEPHANIE
Because I wanted to meet you.

MATT (O.S.)
Why?

STEPHANIE
Because...I-

MATT (O.S.)
Because I can fly.

STEPHANIE
And just...everythingyou were doing,  helping people, it was-

Matt groans, and gives the camera back.



MATT
Yeah, that’s not me.  That’s just, like, who I thought I was supposed to be, right?

Matt sits, contemplating the baseball.  He almost starts to cry but then quickly stops himself, self conscious in front of the camera.

**CUT:**

Matt is standing by the edge, trying to stay away from the camera.

MATT 
You know what it is?  Like what it really is?  I’ve been alone, for like eight months.  I’ve got nothing, I don’t own anything.I would see on TV, people would catch pictures of me, and it would be like I was Bigfoot or something, and I thought, like...
(laughs sourly)
I mean I didn’t even graduate high school, I like-.

Matt laughs, barely a laugh, sardonic and angry.

MATT 
I have zero friends.

STEPHANIE (O.S.)
I’m your friend.

MATT
No, you’re my handler, you’re a camera.  We’re friendly, I like you, but- there is nothing I can say to you that will explain what it’s like to be me.  Life is just a blur.  Everyone treats me different, no one knows what to say to me, everyone’s always thinking too much, and when they listen they listen like, too hard.  I can’t even- I can’t explain it.  There were two people, there were-
(beat, holding back tears)
There were only two people who could’ve understood what I’m going through.  And thanks to me...

Matt tries to collect himself.



MATT
They’re dead.  I could’ve done something, I should’ve done something, I don’t know what and I can’t know what now, but I didn’t, and now they’re both dead.
(beat)
And that’s it.
(beat)
Steve was...Idon’t know if it was an accident.  But I killed Andrew. I killed my friend.
(beat)
I killed my only friend.

Matt, openly crying, shrugs.

MATT 
And that’s it.

BLUR-STATIC AND
THEN...

**FROM HIGHWAY PATROL DASH CAM:**

EXT. RURAL HIGHWAY - NIGHT

A truck has been pulled over by the highway; it’s dark, and the only movement is the occasional thunderous blur of a big rig speeding past.

A big tarp covers the bed of the truck, something large hulking beneath it, creating an odd shape.

There’s a sense of menace almost immediately as the HIGHWAY PATROLMAN walks into frame, headed to the front of the truck.

**CUT:**

Miranda (!) is being walked around to the back, standing next to the massive tarp.

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
Do you know how fast you were going?

Miranda doesn’t respond for a beat, staring at him, nods, then shakes her head.

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN 
Yes?  No?
(beat)
You okay?



Miranda starts to respond; a huge truck rumbles past, startling her, and us.

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN 
Okay, can you respond to me? Anything?

MIRANDA
I don’t...Idon’t know.

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
You don’t know?

Another huge truck blows past, and Miranda flinches.  The cop eyeballs her for a moment, then sighs.

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN 
Just stand right behind your truck there.  I feel like something’s going on and if you can’t confirm or deny that then maybe you should go with me for a minute, yeah?

Miranda stares at him in silence.

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN 
Okay.  I’m gonna call this in, you stay right here.  You’re not gonna run, are you?

Miranda stares at him a beat, then shakes her head, looking around into the night.  The cop laughs, nervous.

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN 
Well okay.

The cop walks back to his car, going around out of sight.

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN (O.S.) 
(on radio)
Yeah, we’ve got a 23103 just north of the 10, code-4right now-

Miranda suddenly turns and runs around the side of the truck, climbing up and disappearing under the tarp.

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN (O.S.) 
(on radio)
Shit, shit- 11-99, subject is- shit-

The cop ditches the radio and comes around back into the headlights, gun drawn.



HIGHWAY PATROLMAN 
Ma’m you come out of there right now!  You come out of there RIGHT NOW!

Silence.  The wind blows.  A faint hum starts from underneath the tarp.

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN 
Miss you have five seconds to comply!  Five!  Four!

A huge truck blows past, startling the cop.

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN 
Three!  Two!  One!

Silence.  The cop edges forward, and tugs at the tarp-

VRRRRRRRRRRRRRMMMMMMMMM!  AN EXPLOSION OF BLUE LIGHT AS THE MINIGUNS OPEN FIRE FROM UNDER THE TARP AS IT FLIES OFF THE TRUCK, THE COP AND THE HOOD OF THE CAR FRAGMENTING TO NOTHING AS THE CAMERA

CRASHES TO
STATIC.

**FROM AIELLO’S CAMERA:**

INT. SAFEHOUSE - KITCHEN

Matt is frantically talking to Aiello, repeatedly pushing the camera away, ignoring it.  His nose is bleeding badly. Stephanie is behind him, trying to calm him down.

MATT
(indicating his nose)
No, okay, this is bad, this is really bad-

STEPHANIE
Matt, calm down for a second and talk-

MATT
No you need to get on the walkie talkie right, you need to tell them to lock this place down now-

AIELLO (O.S.)
Just talk to me, tell me what’s going on-



MATT
I don’t- I can’t- shit shit!

Matt turns, pushing past Stephanie into the

LIVING ROOM

Where his parents are standing, looking alarmed.

MR. GARRETTY
Matt, what’s going on-

MATT
We need to get you out of here, right away, something’s wrong, something’s really wrong!

MRS. GARRETTY
Please just tell us, tell us what’s-

Stephanie’s walkie-talkie buzzes.

MARINE (ON WALKIE)
(quickly)
We’ve got smoke.  We’re condition red.

MATT
What?  What’s that, what did-

Stephanie holds up a hand.

STEPHANIE
What?  Repeat, did not copy-

AIELLO (O.S.)
What’s going on?

MRS. GARRETTY
Oh my god, look.

She’s gone to the window which looks out to the driveway...

...Which is starting to completely flood with smoke from smoke grenades, the whole area outside blotting with impenetrable fog.

MATT
Mom, no, okay, no!

Matt hurries and pulls his mother away from the window, closer to his dad.  The camera glimpses something enter the room, and turns.



The Whirlybird has floated in through a window.

STEPHANIE
SHIT, MIKE, CAMERA DOWN, GUN OUT, NOW.

MRS. GARRETTY
What’s going on, Matt what’s going on-

Aiello’s camera goes down, and we jump to

!THE WHIRLYBIRD CAMERA.

Where we see the entire room, Matt, his parents, the agents, all staring at it, Aiello tossing down his digital camera and drawing his pistol.

Everyone’s boggled.  Stephanie steps forward, plucking it out of the air, looking directly into it.

Stephanie stares into the Whirlybird camera.

STEPHANIE
What is this-

!THE WALL BEHIND HER EXPLODES INWARD, MR. AND MRS. GARRETTY BEING FLUNG DOWN VIOLENTLY!  THE ROOM IS SUDDENLY FILLED WITH CRAZY BLUE LIGHT AS EVERYTHING IS SHREDDED BY THE MINI GUNS, SWISS-CHEESING THE WHOLE BOTTOM FLOOR OF THE HOUSE, THE SONIC WEAPONS SHATTERING ALL THE GLASS AND DISTORTING EVERYTHING INTO CHAOS.

The whirlybird is yanked down, and sees absolutely none of this clearly.

And then...silence.

After a moment, it hovers up again, showing us the trashed room.  Matt’s parents are down, and in dazed agony.  Matt is slowly getting up, shaking away rubble.

The Whirlybird focuses him on him, approaching, and we can see Stephanie getting up from rubble behind him.

Matt’s clearly in shock, moving jerkily, disoriented, as he heads towards the massive hole in the wall.

STEPHANIE 
Matt stay inside.  STAY INSIDE.

Matt takes another cautious step forward, and makes a gentle movement with his hands: in a beautiful, memorable reveal, the smoke telekinetically parts, sweeping aside to reveal:

!THE MARTYR SUIT.

The fever dream of the prototype has graduated into a nightmare.

The monstrous suit completely hides the wearer inside, and the number of minigun “arms” has been upped to four; they stick out over the shoulders and from the hips.

This gives the entire design a vaguely arachnid appearance; it’s unsettling.  Like the prototype, it’s clearly been make-shifted together from a thousand different sources, but this is cleaner, meaner, stronger, and a thousand times more deadly.

MATT
...Holy shit.

Matt stands staring up at the Martyr suit, framed in its spotlights.  Shock and awe.

He’s never seen anything like this before.  No one has.

STEPHANIE
Matt, MATT-

They’re a crackle of electricity all over the suit, and then A BOLT OF LIGHTNING CATCHES MATT FLUSH IN THE CHEST, FLINGING HIM BACKWARDS LIKE A RAGDOLL.

AIELLO
BRING IT DOWN!  BRING IT DOWN!

Dozens of agents and marines emerge from the smoke, GUNS RAISED, and open fire on the Martyr suit simultaneously, dozens of bullets sparking and bouncing off it-

-but evidence of damage is present IMMEDIATELY; the suit is meant to fight Matt, not the army, and it’s taking some serious hits here.

Miranda has no choice: she fires back blindly at the military with all weapons-

Bad idea.

STEPHANIE
NOT ENOUGH, LIGHT IT UP!

A barrage of grenades and rockets flies in KNOCKING THE MARTYR SUIT AROUND LIKE A WHIRLING DERVISH!



Inside the suit, we see the various panels and displays cracking, sirens going off.  The Martyr suit isn’t built to confront conventional weapons.

Miranda, inside the suit, screeches in psychotic anger and frustration.

The suit LAUNCHES INTO THE AIR, speeding away, in full retreat.

The military slowly creeps forward.

SLAM TO:

**FROM AIELLO’S CAMERA:**

It’s frantic and shaky, with Matt, on a gurney in an ambulance, Stephanie at his side; EMTsare working on him, an oxygen mask on his face.

People are running and talking everywhere, it’s a mess.

STEPHANIE 
Not now Mike.

AIELLO (O.S.)
But-

STEPHANIE
NOT NOW.

Stephanie slams closed the ambulance doors.

HARD CUT TO
BLACK.

!HOLD ON BLACK.

**FROM HOSPITAL ROOM CAMS:**

INT. CLEAN ROOM

Several different cameras have been set up for clinical observation; like he’s a lab rat.  Matt is in a hospital bed, the only thing in the room; it clearly wasn’t really intended for this purpose.

Hanson sits next to the bed, deep in thought.  Matt stirs, and he sits up.

Matt’s groggy and pained.

HANSON
Hey kid.

MATT
Hey.
(long beat)
Are my parents okay?

HANSON
(beat)
No.

MATT
Are they alive?

HANSON
Yes.  Mom’s got three broken ribs, dad’s right arm and leg are broken. Both of them have hearing damage.

Matt lays still, processing this.

HANSON 
Someone’s here to speak to you, if you’re feeling up to it.

MATT
Shouldn’t you be working?

HANSON
I am working.  Brought you some clothes, didn’t I?

Matt laughs, trying to get up, slowly, painfully, and Hanson goes to him, helping him into a sitting position.

MATT
I never wanted all this.  I just wanted...Iwanted everything to be okay.  I thought I’d get answers, of what happened, of why it happened, why me, you know?  I just wanted everything to be okay.

HANSON
I know, Matt.

MATT
...You know, when I first met you, I thought you were a real uptight asshole.



HANSON
Yeah, and I thought you were an immature megalomaniac.

Matt laughs.  Hanson helps Matt to his feet.

HANSON 
Turns out we were both right.

**FROM INTERROGATION ROOM CAMERAS:**

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - SHORTLY THEREAFTER

The room has a plain steel table, a two way mirror, and three chairs.  It’s sparse...exceptfor the little automated clicks and whirrsof the five wall and ceiling mounted cameras.

Matt notices every single one.We can feel him seething against them; so can Hanson.

HANSON
Easy.

MATT
Psh.

The door opens and two marines step in, armed with high powered rifles, and then, after a moment

GENERAL POOL, late 40s, enters.  He’s an immaculately clean man, wearing the uniform of a four star general.  There’s something bright and aware about him; we’re looking at an officer’s officer, the absolute cream of the crop.

He holds a large file folder.

Hanson stands and salutes, and Matt hurriedly stands as well, not really sure whether to salute or not, awkward.  Pool simply looks at them both.

HANSON
General Pool.  Something wrong, sir?

GENERAL POOL
I understood he was...incapacitated, hospitalized-

HANSON
Kid’s a fast healer.



GENERAL POOL
I am attempting to give you sensitive information; there were certain parameters for the delivery of this information.

MATT
What, you thought you were gonna read me a bedtime story?

Pool takes a beat, and gives a thin, tight-lipped smile.

MATT 
I’m sorry, I- sorry.

GENERAL POOL
You both can go ahead and take a seat.

Hanson nods, and sits down next to Matt, who, still pained, slumps down next to him.  Pool sits across from them, glancing at them cameras.

It forms an odd sort of tableau: it almost looks like a single dad and his son at a parent teacher conference.

Pool opens his folder, drawing out a picture of Miranda Hodgkins.

MATT
This is her, this is her!
(to Hanson)
That’s her, holy shit-

Matt falls quiet, listening as Pool talks; the excited look on his face gradually falls to one of blank confusion.

GENERAL POOL
Miranda Hodgkins, french expatriate, is, by our numbers, one of the most intelligent people on the planet-

MATT
Wait, stop, you know who she  is? She’s like a- she’s like a known thing?
(shocked beat)
What?-

GENERAL POOL
Let me finish.



MATT
Let you FINISH-

HANSON
Matt, come on.

Matt looks to Hanson, who stares at him, cool as a cucumber. He goes quiet.

General Pool begins pushing out documents and photographs from the file, playing them out like solitaire.

GENERAL POOL
At age seven Miranda was pulled out of public school.  Both her and her sister tested at genius level, but only Miranda was inducted into the Project Opal.

MATT
Opal-

GENERAL POOL
Opal has existed since 1961, the purpose of the program being to locate, gather, integrate and educate children of exceptional intellect to better serve the interests of the United States of America-

MATT
Some military genius school, what’re you- Hanson,  c’mon, this is some conspiracy shitman -

GENERAL POOL
Around age thirteen Miranda began to show signs of some kind of behavioral, or mental disorder.

He shows pictures of Miranda’s crazed writings, a young Miranda covered in equations, not unlike what we were seeing in Jack’s house not-so-long-ago.

GENERAL POOL 
By the time she was seventeen, she had manifested delusional paranoia, as well as intense and unpredictable moodswings.  She was formally diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar, and summarily removed from the active program.



MATT
...So for ten years, you were teaching this psycho to do WHAT exactly?

GENERAL POOL
(beat)
Engineering.  Cybernetics. Mathematical Physics-

MATT
Oh so just the basics then-

GENERAL POOL
About two years after she left the program, Miranda met this man, Jack Fisk.

MATT
(covering his face)
Holy shit, holy shit-

GENERAL POOL
Fisk was an ex-con, an anarchist with a long history of bad behavior.
(beat)
His brother, Terrance Fisk, was killed in the incident in Seattle.
(beat)
Miranda became, we think, obsessed with him, and in turn, after Seattle,gradually adopted his fledgling psychosis regarding...you.

Matt is frantically trying to remain calm; he’s passed anger by a mile, and is now making the slow arc through complete shock.His head his hanging.

MATT
How long have you known about this?

GENERAL POOL
Six months.  When Miranda hacked the Haven Hills server and pirated the footage from Andrew Detmer’s camera and the Seattle Catastrophe-

HANSON
-Slow down, why wasn’t I informed about this?-



GENERAL POOL
We tracked the style of the hacking back to Project Opal, and found that Hodgkinsand Fisk were living together in Los Angeles-

HANSON
No, I said slow down.  Why wasn’t I informed about this?

GENERAL POOL
Mr. Hanson, this is above your clearance-

MATT
You knew that they were doing- she was building that thing-

GENERAL POOL
We knew that she was doing something having to do with you-

MATT
You knew.  So when they released that movie, when they attacked me...whenshe tried to murder my parents- You knew.
(genuinely flummoxed)
Why?

Pool gives a polite smile, closing the file.

GENERAL POOL
For eight months, the Garretty issue has been hotly debated.  We can’t seem to find a clean mechanism to control, inhibit or even predict your movements.  You show no respect for authority, and move without consequence.  And, thusly, there is an interest, at the highest level, in some form of deterrent.
(beat)
Against you.
(beat)
We felt it best to allow Miss Hodgkins to continue her research until such she’d developed something we could use, should your erratic behavior ever turn dangerous.

Matt stares at Pool.



GENERAL POOL 
Matthew, I-

Matt TELEKINETICALLY FLIPS THE TABLE ASIDE, LUNGING AT POOL-

Hanson catches him, holding him back, as Pool retreats against the wall, terrified-

HANSON
MATT!  MATT GODDAMN IT STOP IT-

MATT
A DETERRENT!?  YOU DON’T “MATTHEW” ME YOU ASSHOLE-

Pool tries to hurry out of the room, but he’s YANKED BACK IN telekinetically and lands hard on his back.  The marines rush in, and are flung into opposite walls, one of them SLAMMING INTO OUR CAMERA.

HARD CUT TO:

**FROM AIELLO’S CAMERA:**

EXT. HAVEN HILLS FACILITY - EVENING

We’re outside of the Haven Hills facility, under floodlights in a parking area.  Matt is furious, rightfully so, as Aiello rushes up to where he’s confronting Hanson, who seems frantic and upset, but not at all afraid.

MATT
(to camera)

I SWEAR TO GOD GET THE HELL OUT OF
HERE-

HANSON
Calm down, NOW-

MATT
(yelling right at Hanson)

UH-HUH, RIGHT!  RIGHT SORRY, I’LL
JUST CALM DOWN-

HANSON
YOU WANNA GET IN MY FACE?  IS THAT WHAT YOU WANNA DO?

Hanson steps towards Matt, and Matt paces, reconsidering.

HANSON 
So you just attacked a five star general, what’s next?  What’s next, huh-



MATT
I’m going to go break your new toy.

HANSON
Hey, I didn’t know about this-

MATT
WHY SHOULD I BELIEVE YOU?  WHY? What have you ever done for me, NOTHING.  You’ve done NOTHING but make things worse-

HANSON
So you want to be alone?  You want it to be you versus her?  You saw that thing she built, it’s designed to murder you, you got lucky once, you can’t win-

MATT
Yeah well we’ll see about that-

HANSON
-and they're waiting for that, men with drills and scalpels who’ve been drooling for the day you screw up and get yourself killed, to take you apart and run tests on that oh-so-special brain of yours-

MATT
I’m not afraid, stop trying to scare me!

HANSON
It’s bigger than that too, Matt, because even if you win the fight, you lose the argument, you go off the rails and you prove her right, you prove Jack right, you prove that prick Pool right too-

MATT
Stop it!  I have to do this-

HANSON
You want to hurt someone?  You want to let anger and fear take you over-

MATT
-Stop it- shut up!-



HANSON
You want to be Andrew?  You want to be an “apex predator-”

That’s the last straw.

MATT
I said SHUT UP!

Hanson is knocked to the ground by a wave of telekinetic force, which hits Mike and knocks us down too.

Matt, shocked at his own violence, stands silently staring at Hanson.

HANSON
Matt-

Matt launches into the air.Aiello, lowering the camera, rushes to Hanson.

AIELLO (O.S.)
Are you-

HANSON (O.S.)
Is Stephanie still in California?

AIELLO (O.S.)
I- yes-

HANSON (O.S.)
Get her on the line.  He’s going to Los Angeles, I need a helicopter- now.

**FROM WHIRLYBIRD CAMERA:**

INT. JACK’S HOUSE - BASEMENT - SUNSET

Miranda is framed against a big flatscreenTV in the basement, which is showing a news broadcast.  It shows helicopter shots of West Los Angeles, Santa Monica, where the sun is setting.

We can see that Matt is flying around the area, from helicopter and live on the street shots.

The broadcaster speaks in harried tones.

BROADCASTER (ON TELEVISION)
-Santa Monica, where just over an hour ago Matt Garretty appeared, demanding to speak to someone named “Miranda Hodgkins.”

We can hear Matt yelling “MIRANDA!”  He looks more than a little crazy.

BROADCASTER (O.S.) 
We go now to Toby Carter live on the scene, Toby?

TOBY CARTER is in downtown Santa Monica.

TOBY CARTER
Mere days after the San Francisco attack that took three lives, and left the entire world in shock, Matt Garretty-

Matt lands next to him, telekinetically sucking the camera up into the air with him, and then dropping it letting it clatter to the street.

MATT
You miss Jack, Miranda?  COME ON OUT, I’LL HELP YOU SEE HIM AGAIN.

We hear Miranda begin SHRIEKING in psychotic rage, over and over; she RUSHES UP TO THE TELEVISION, RIPPING IT OFF THE WALL AND HURLING IT TO THE GROUND.

**CUT:**

Miranda is storming through the basement, starting up various machines to charge the Martyr suit, muttering to herself at a million miles an hour.

She keeps knocking things off counters, tripping on the clutter; she’s completely out of control and then-

A loud pounding at the door upstairs.  Miranda freezes.

**CUT:**

Miranda, carrying her kitchen knife, heads rapidly up the stairs.

**CUT:**

Miranda stalks through the living room, to find the front door OPENING-



MIRANDA
Get out of here!  Get-

POLLY Hodgkins, 30, clean cut with bright, intelligent eyes, walks in.

Miranda drops the knife, and Polly immediately goes to her.

POLLY
Jesus christ,Miranda.

Polly sits her down on the ratty couch, the Whirlybird moving in closer; the sisters talk at a mile a minute as the camera moves around them.

MIRANDA
Polly- you don’t- you shouldn’t be here, I don’t want you to be here-

POLLY
My god, you look like you’re dying, when was the last time you ate-

MIRANDA
I don’t- I don’t know- please just leave, please Polly just leave-

POLLY
It took me two years to find you, I’m not leaving now- oh god Miranda what’d you do, I saw Jack in that thing, did you build it?

Miranda nods.

POLLY 
God Miranda have you seen, Garretty is on TV shouting your name-

MIRANDA
I have to kill him.

POLLY
Why?

MIRANDA
...Jack said-

POLLY
Jack, ugh, Jack- what do you keep looking at?

Polly stands up, looking at the open basement door that Polly Miranda keeps staring at.



POLLY 
What’s down there Miranda?

MIRANDA
The armor.

POLLY
The armor...likeJack was wearing on TV?

Miranda’s quiet, rocking.

POLLY 
Stay here.

Polly turns and goes down the stairs, taking a moment to give the whirlybird a confused glance; she’s seen weirder from Miranda in the past, clearly.

Miranda sits rocking and muttering to herself, then stands and quickly goes to

THE BASEMENT

The Whirlybird following closely, to find Polly standing in front of a computer, reading, rapt.  Polly turns, noticing Miranda.

POLLY 
This is incredible.

Polly rushing to Miranda, hugging her; Miranda’s clearly confused by this, and Polly, pulls her to the laptop, and the Martyr suit.

POLLY 
This is cold fusion, Miranda.  YOU

CRACKED COLD FUSION.
And...magneticflight?  This is the most significant scientific discovery of-

MIRANDA
That- it doesn’t matter-

POLLY
Doesn’t matter!?  You can change the world, don’t you see that?

MIRANDA
It’s for the cause- Jack says-



POLLY
Jack killed people at the stadium, with your weapon, Miranda.  What does that make YOU?Do the math. What does that make you?

This actually seems to get through to Miranda; she falters, thinking.

MIRANDA
Polly, I have to-

POLLY
You don’t have to do anything. This is ending right now, Mimi. You’re not thinking clearly. Remember what happens when you don’t take your medications, you’re not thinking clearly, and you’re hurting people.You don’t want that.  I won’t believe it.

Miranda’s silent for a moment, then begins sobbing uncontrollably and lurches forward, into Polly’s arms.

POLLY 
Hey.  Hey, it’s okay.

MIRANDA
I don’t know what’s happening, I don’t know what’s happening anymore.  I’m so confused.  I’m so scared.

POLLY
It’s okay.  We’ll go to the police.

MIRANDA
They’ll- they’ll arrest me-

POLLY
Not with this, not with all this. It won’t be easy, but Miranda- listen, just stay right here, okay, stay right here.

Polly turns, and plucks the Whirlybird out of the air, and snaps it in half-

DIGITAL
DISTORTION CRASH TO BLACK.

!BUT THEN...



**FROM MIRANDA’S CAMERA:**

We’re slowly picked up off a table in the basement, raised up, so we can now see Polly rapidly putting away various lap tops, shutting things down, packing up.

POLLY 
-it's all going to be okay Mimi, you’lll see.  They’ve been looking for you a long time, they’ll be happy to have you back.  And I promise I’ll stay with you, no matter what.

As she talks, the camera has slowly approached her from behind.  Polly turns, and gives a little start, surprised.

POLLY 
...Why are you filming me-

The camera suddenly lurches in at incredible speed; THUNK, into POlly’s forehead, cracking the lens!

Polly falls backward with a shout of pain and then-

DIGITAL
DISTORTION

We go through several; this camera is MESSED up, the data bending and scrambled, the lens broken.

!IN ON...

Polly waking up.  There’s blood smudged down her face.  She tries to get up, and finds that she’s been handcuffed to the leg of a heavy work table.

In a mirror behind her, we can see Miranda’s reflection, looming over her sister, the camera held in front of her face.

POLLY 
(dazed)
Miranda...no...no...please listen...

MIRANDA
(long beat)
I have to do this.  It’s too late to turn back.

POLLY
Miranda, he’ll kill you, please don’t-



MIRANDA
I’ve gone too far.  It’s bigger than us now.  I owe it to Jack.  He was the only one who cared about me.

Miranda presses her auto-start button, and they’re both suddenly bathed in the glow of the Martyr suit’s lights.

Oh shit.

**FROM NEWS CAMERAS/BYSTANDER CAMERAS:**

EXT. SANTA MONICA - THIRD STREET PROMENADE

The area has been cordoned off by police blockades, which we see briefly, before switching focus to Matt, who’s flying back and forth, angrily.

Stephanie appears, holding her camera as always, moving towards him, yelling up to Matt.  He looks down at her, clearly furious, and shouts something back.

Stephanie chucks her camera away without a second thought, and implores Matt to come down.

After a moment, he floats down to her, clearly upset.  They talk, going back and forth, with Matt gradually calming down...

!THE MARTYR SUIT LANDS RIGHT BETWEEN THEM, SMASHING STEPHANIE ASIDE LIKE A RAGDOLL BEFORE LUNGING AT MATT, TACKLING HIM THROUGH THE GLASS WINDOWS OF A STORE-FRONT-

BYSTANDER
JESUS CHRIST WHAT THE HELL IS THAT!?

Blue gattling gun rounds  GO SPRAYING OUT OF THE STOREFRONT IN ALL DIRECTIONS, causing tons of collateral damage, and then the Martyr suit is blown back out onto the promenade.

It pulls itself to its feet as Matt exits the destroyed store, and launches at him-

Matt CATCHES IT MID-AIR.

!WE INTEGRATE THE MARTYR POVCAM INTO OUR MEDLEY...

The Martyr suit, dangling, fires the sonic disrupters, and Matt staggers backwards, losing focus long enough for the suit to LURCH FORWARD and SWAT HIM LIKE A VOLLEYBALL-

Matt is brutally launched into the air, hits the ground and rolls before taking off-

The Martyr suit launches after him, and we’re treated to a breathtaking few seconds as we chase Matt, midflight, all guns firing through loops and corkscrews as he attempts to evade the suit before-

WHAM!  Matt slams into us and we PLUNGE FROM THE SKY-

We watch as Matt and the Martyr Suit go crashing through a billboard before slamming down onto Ocean Avenue, DEMOLISHING a tourism info-kiosk.

**FROM AIELLO’S CAMERA:**

INT. SANTA MONICA - TEMPORARY FIELD COMMAND

We’re set up in a coffee shop, with lap-tops everywhere, national guardsmen and government agents running all over the place.

The camera is currently filming Hanson as we walks in, to see General Pool giving orders to some technical officers.

HANSON
Mike you film this whole thing, I don’t care who tells you to stop, got it?

Pool noticed Hanson, and looks alarmed.

GENERAL POOL
Mr. Hanson, your orders were to remain at Haven Hills-

HANSON
What is this “don’t interfere” bullshit?  These are two kids out there, they need our help-

GENERAL POOL
Garretty is out of control-

HANSON
-Matt is- what?-

GENERAL POOL
If Miss Hodgkins fails to contain him then we will step in, but-

HANSON
(shouting, abrupt, pissed)
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND?

The entire room goes near silent, all eyes on the two highest ranking officers.

GENERAL POOL
You might want to reconsider your tone-

HANSON
(letting it all out)
She's the criminal, not him!  She’s the one-

GENERAL POOL
Mr. Hanson-

HANSON
-brandishing a goddamn WMD around an American city-

GENERAL POOL
Garretty has attacked members of the military-

HANSON
So has she!  She just flattened a goddamn federal agent-

GENERAL POOL
-he’s endangering the lives of civilians-

HANSON
BECAUSE OF HER, WHAT ARE YOU NOT SEEING?  He’s a twenty year old kid just trying to do the right thing, and you’re sending him out to slaughter-

GENERAL POOL
Because we can stop her.  Only she can stop him.  Do you understand? We can’t control him, you’ve proven that.  Now a line has to be drawn.

Hanson starts to speak, but then stops himself.

HANSON
This is it?  This is the call you’re making?
(beat)
You’re going to let a bipolar schizophrenic wielding a future-tech military grade weapon “duke it out” with the world’s only superhuman in a populated city, and then swoop in and shoot the survivor in the head, that’s the call you’re making?  Just so I’m clear.

General Pool calmly looks back at him.  Hanson almost laughs.

HANSON 
Wow, Chris.  You are so screwed.
(beat)
Anyone who doesn’t want to be part of the court martial, you give me your car keys right now.

**FROM NEWS/BYSTANDER CAMERAS:**

EXT. SANTA MONICA - OCEAN AVENUE

The Martyr suit is firing with all of its miniguns as it stalks towards Matt, who’s holding his telekinetic ground, leading to a tremendous amount of splash damage all around him, which our camera-holding pedestrians have to frantically dodge!

Matt flicks his wrists and two cars launch from either side of the street, SANDWICHING the Martyr suit between them!

It falls, but then knocks the cars away and OPENS UP WITH THE SONIC WEAPONS.  Matt lurches, staggering, as car windows shatter and car alarms go off all around him.

The suit slowly steps forward, getting closer...andcloser...

The sonics KICK INTO HIGH GEAR, street lights shattering, several of the camera lenses cracking, Matt dropping to his knees...

Matt, screaming in agony, begins crawling away as the Martyr suit stalks towards him; his nose is bleeding badly, and we realize he’s helpless.

The Lightning Bug begins to rev, CHARGING UP...

This is it.  Matt’s going to die.

Just like Andrew died.  Angry, alone and scared.

A GOVERNMENT TRUCK SLAMS INTO THE MARTYR SUIT, smashing it to the ground; THE SONIC WEAPONS ARE DESTROYED IN THE IMPACT, shattering and shutting off.

Matt, confused and in pain, watches as Hanson (!), carrying an automatic shotgun, hops out of the drivers’ side, perfectly calm, and walks around to the Martyr suit, which is trying weakly to lift the truck off it.

Hanson raises the shotgun and fires into the suit’s “face” three times; the hits are so direct it actually does damage.

MATT
Hanson GET OUT OF HERE!  Get away from it!

HANSON
FLY AWAY.  YOU.
(points to the sky)
FLY AWAY.

MATT
No Hanson RUN!  You have to run, go!

Hanson calmly goes around to the side of the still struggling suit and jams the shotgun into the “elbow” of the Martyr’s left arm, and fires, BAM, and again, BAM.

The arm sparks and lets off jets of hydraulic steam, breaking.  Hanson goes around to the other arm.

HANSON
Miranda Hodgkins, deactivate the weapon and come out with your hands-

Miranda, inside the suit, screams in incoherent rage, and then SWINGS THE RIGHT ARM, SMASHING HANSON TO THE GROUND, pinning him under its “hand.”

The impact is shocking; it’s as though he was hit by a car, and he lays motionless on the cracked asphalt.

MATT
No!  No!

One of the gattling gun “arms” comes up, and Matt is  suddenly on it, RIPPING IT CLEAN OFF IN A LOUD SHOWER OF FIRE AND SPARKS!

Miranda, inside the suit, shrieks in anger as alarms and sirens go off all around her.

The Martyr suit SPRINGS INTO THE AIR, but Matt holds on as it takes off and it SMASHES ERRATICALLY INTO THE GROUND, sliding in a WAVE OF SPARKS RIGHT TOWARD ONE OF OUR CIVILIAN POVS (yikes!) before VEERING OFF INTO THE AIR-

EXT. SANTA MONICA PIER - CONTINUOUS

They tumble out of control through the sky, down over the PCH, smacking into the sand and rolling violently right up into the surf, alongside Santa Monica Pier!

!PEOPLE ARE FILMING FROM THE PIER AT THIS POINT, MANY OF THEM PANICKING AND RUNNING.

The suit stands on the beach, watching as Matt, in the water, slowly struggles to his feet.  It begins charging the Lightning Bug again, electricity crackling all over, THIS IS THE KILL SHOT!

Matt telekinetically SPRAYS SEA WATER UP ONTO THE MARTYR SUIT-

The Lightning Bug short circuits, SPRAYING ELECTRICITY EVERYWHERE, lighting the whole Martyr suit on fire-

Matt ATTACKS-

ON THE PIER

Matt and the Martyr suit come CRASHING UP THROUGH THE WOODEN PIER, landing HARD next to the ferris wheel .

BYSTANDER
(to his family)
Run!  Go!  RUN!

The suit, on fire and malfunctioning badly, SMACKS Matt away (ow), before turning around, trying to regaining control...butthen...

The suit...stops.  It’s staring up at the Ferris Wheel. Miranda, inside, is clearly frozen.

What the hell is she doing?  How did she come from that idyllic night with Jack to...this?

There’s a cranking, wrenching sound and the suit camera turns to see Matt, kneeling, both hands raised, pulling-

She spins in time to see the Ferris wheel TIP AND FALL, CRUSHING THE MARTYR SUIT UNDER IT.

Matt stumbles, wiping his nose-



AND THE MARTYR SUIT BURSTS FROM THE WRECKAGE- But he catches it immediately, TELEKINETICALLY PARALYZING IT IN PLACE, holding up a hand, the Martyr suit helplessly spread, its eight limbs trembling before-

Matt SPREADS HIS FINGERS, VIOLENTLY SEPARATING THE MARTYR SUIT INTO ALL OF ITS COMPONENT PARTS IN A BURST OF SPARKS, SMOKE AND FLAME.

The wreckage falls away, and the torso clatters to the ground, helpless.  There’s an awful wrenching sound as Matt approaches it, and it’s peeled open like a can of beans, exposing Miranda inside.

BYSTANDER 
It’s...it’s a girl.

Matt stares at her for a moment, lit by the carnival lights, and then rips her out and throws her to the ground.

Miranda, clearly dazed, begins to crawl away, trying to get up.

MATT
WHAT DID YOU DO?  WHAT DID YOU DO? You took everything from me!

MIRANDA
...please...I’m sorry...Idon’t...I don’t know what I’m doing-

Matt pantomimes not being able to hear Miranda as she begs him, cupping his hand to his ear, and then flicks his hand at her; one of the severed arms of the suit flips up and smashes her down!

We can hear the people filming react with horror.

He stalks towards as she slowly begins trying to crawl her way out from under the arm.

MATT
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?  WHERE ARE YOU

TRYING TO GO?  IT’S DONE, IT’S
OVER.

MIRANDA
Please...please...

MATT
It’s OVER.



Matt telekinetically lifts her, VIOLENTLY HURLING HER INTO A WALL.  The attack is punctuated by its intention, its straight, unmitigated, unfiltered malevolence.

Miranda collapses in a heap.  That impact broke bones; maybe all of them.  Matt stares at her collapsed form, and his anger slowly fades...

...into horror.  He looks around at the wrecked pier, the fires burning in the distance on 3rd street...Jesus christ, what did he do?

He takes one last look at Miranda, and then launches off into the air.

Miranda’s crumpled form stirs.  Our closer angles show that she’s coughing up blood, barely able to move.

Police cars and government vehicles are rallying at the far end of the pier.  Helicopters are everywhere in the sky.

Matt was right.  It’s over.

People begin to creep forward, towards her, our cameras getting closer when-

Sonic BOOM Matt’s back!  Everybody hurriedly backs up before refocusing.

He lands next to Miranda, standing over her, silent, staring at her.  She reaches out weakly, pulling at his pant leg, and then collapses, going limp.

By god, is she...

He kneels down next to her.  We can see Matt’s lips, but not hear him, as he picks up the dying Miranda in his arms.

Matt places a hand on her chest, saying something.  His nose begins to drip blood.  The camera zooms in; something is happening to Miranda...

...her cuts are closing....thebruises  vanishing...thebones unbreaking...

ANONYMOUS VIEWER
Oh my god.

We can hear people behind the cameras muttering in astonishment.  This is it.  He’s the messiah.

Miranda GASPS IN AIR!



Miranda looks up at him, clearly in a stupor, tears pouring down her face, and he gently sets her down, standing slowly over her...

...He looks up and sees us, the cameras, watching him, some very close; he reels looking at each angle.  He looks up to see the helicopters overhead.

MATT
(barely audible)
Oh no.  No no no no no.  No shit no no no no!

Oh yes, Matt.  The whole world saw what you just did.  People will be talking.  Oh yes they will.

MATT 
No!  NO!

Sonic BOOM Matt launches off the pier, disappearing over the ocean.  Dozens of cops and army troopers advance on Miranda in a massive surge...

...She slowly sits up, for a moment covered in laser sights (a strangely familiar visual), before they TAZERHER AND SHOVE HER DOWN, locking on the handcuffs.

**FROM AIELLO’S CAMERA:**

EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN - DAWN

We’re onboard a blackhawk helicopter, moving fast over the ocean.  Hanson, his ribs bandaged and his arm in a sling, sits in front of us, deep in thought.

**CUT:**

The ocean passes by under us.

**CUT:**

AIELLO (O.S.)
There he is, there he is!

Indeed, there’s Matt, floating out over the ocean.  He sees the helicopter, and shakes his head.

MATT
Leave me alone!

MATT
It won’t- it’s not even- You don’t know what I did- everybody saw!



Matt floats around to the other side of the helicopter.

HANSON
It’s not over Matt, you’ve got options-

MATT
I’ve got NOTHING!  I’m not even gonna be a person anymore!

HANSON
Matt, please!

Matt stops, thinking.  We zoom in on his face as he looks down at the ocean, los in his thoughts.

MATT
Man, don’t you get it?  It doesn’t matter.  Nothing matters now.
(beat)
I’m never going to be normal again.

HANSON
We can talk about it, we can figure it out!  You and me.

MATT
(beat)
No.  It’s too late.  I...Ican’t. I’m sorry I let you down.

HANSON
Matt-

Sonic BOOM he's gone.  Hanson lowers the mega phone, staring out at the sunrise.  He turns to the camera, looking at it for a moment, thinking, and then.

HANSON 
Turn it off.  Just...turnit off.

**CUT TO BLACK:**

**FROM INTERROGATION ROOM CAMERAS:**

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM

We’re back in that clean room, with cameras of all types mounted at all angles, zooming and turning, focusing and refocusing to reveal...



Miranda, sitting alone at the table.  She’s staring straight ahead, trance like.  The door suddenly opens, and Hanson comes in, still bandaged, his broken arm hanging loosely.

He pulls out a chair and sits down in front of Miranda.  The two of them stare at each other.

HANSON
You remember me?

After a beat, she nods, averting her eyes.

HANSON 
You broke two of my ribs, my collar bone, my arm.  The other agent you attacked is still in intensive care.  You’re indited on two dozen separate federal crimes, and there’s a massive inquiry underway to try to figure who let you get as far as you did.
(beat)
As of right now, you, Miranda Hodgkins, are no longer a person. You are property of the United States government.  You understand that, yes?

MIRANDA
(beat)
Yes.

HANSON
I understand you’re back on your medication.

MIRANDA
Yes.

HANSON
No racing thoughts, delusions, nothing like that?

Miranda shakes her head.

MIRANDA
Is my sister-

HANSON
She’s angry.  Everyone’s...pretty angry.  You’ve got no friends left.

Miranda’s quiet for a moment.



MIRANDA
Have they found him?

Hanson can’t hide the sadness in his voice.

HANSON
No.

Miranda’s quiet.

MIRANDA
(beat)
He is alone.  Like I am alone.  He won’t fit into this world, just like I don’t fit into this world. And I have maybe ruined his chance to be one of us, to be a human again.

Miranda sits in silence, and then.

MIRANDA 
I was wrong.  Jack was wrong, too. Matt isn’t the bad guy.
(beat)
It’s us.  We’re the villains.

Hanson slumps, slightly.  He knows she’s right.Miranda speaks without looking up.

MIRANDA
He’’ll be back.

HANSON
And how do you figure that?

MIRANDA
Because I know him now.  He’s the hero.

FLASH TO

On the burning pier, Matt kneels over the sobbing Miranda as she dies.  We’re at a much closer vantage point now, and this time, we can hear what Matt said just before he healed her.

MATT
I’m sorry.  I understand, and I’m sorry.

BACK TO:

MIRANDA
He saved me.



Miranda sits in silence, and then raises her eyes to meet the camera, staring into it.

SLAM TO TITLE:
MARTYR.
