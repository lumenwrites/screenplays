!FADE IN:

INT. PSYCHOLOGIST’S OFFICE - DAY

It’s an upscale psychologist’s office, well appointed and

brightly lit from floor to ceiling windows.

MARTHA McKay , 29, lays on the couch.  She’s very pretty but

without make-up save somewhat heavy eyeliner, lacking any

kind of fashion sense, and also minus the poise and self-

assured mannerisms that make beautiful women seem

unreachable.  She seems terminally awkward in her own body.

She’s talking to DOCTOR Lisa KENNER , 31, very sexy, with

long, slender legs, who sits across from her.

DOCTOR KENNER

It’s nice to have you back, Martha.

MARTHA

Thanks Doctor Kenner, I spent like, the

last fifteen days in bed crying, out of

bed crying, back in bed, so, here I am,

here is me.

Kenner nods and smiles.

DOCTOR KENNER

And, how would you say you’re feeling

now?

MARTHA

I guess I just feel...I don’t know.  I’d

want to say I feel betrayed, but is that,

is that cliche?

DOCTOR KENNER

No, it’s not cliche if it’s what you

feel.

MARTHA

I just don’t want to hide behind pre-

established ideas, I mean, I’ve been

cheated on before.

DOCTOR KENNER

I know, Daniel.

MARTHA

That’s right, but this is different.

DOCTOR KENNER

Do you feel Robert did something

different?  You were with him for just

under a year.

MARTHA

It’s not that he did something different,

I just...It was like he had another life.

One woman, I could handle, it’d be fucked

(up, but I could handle it. slowly sits up as she talks)

But I mean...I have no idea, it’s scary,

but I have no idea how many women he was

sleeping with.  And I mean, they weren’t,

I’ve seen them. They weren’t like, better

than me.

DOCTOR KENNER

Did you want them to be?

MARTHA

Well no, I just...I don’t know.

DOCTOR KENNER

Do you feel like it’s your fault?

MARTHA

My fault?

DOCTOR KENNER

Think about it.

Martha sits thinking.

MARTHA

(shaking her head)

No, NO, okay, no, I don’t feel that way.

Why should I, I gave him everything, I

trusted him, and then to go through his

phone and find text messages about having

anal sex in a hot tub?  That’s what

eleven months earned me?  My fucking

fault ? Fuck that .

Doctor Kenner looks uncomfortable.

!MARTHA (CONT’D)

But you know, maybe it is.  It’s my fault

for ever thinking this guy, this

sycophantic, smarmy pretentious piece of

self-involved dogshit could ever-

DOCTOR KENNER

I think you’re being unfair, here.

!CON TINUE D:

!(CO NTINU ED)

MARTHA

(beat)

What?  Unfair to him?  What?  This awful

unbelievable fucking asshole who acts

like he wants to marry me and then every

second we’re apart is balls deep in some

harem of washed out sluts-

DOCTOR KENNER

(adjusting her glasses)

Sluts is a very strong term.  I think you

need to be a little understanding; Robbie

is a very high pressure, intense

individual and...

Doctor Kenner trails off as she realizes that Martha is

staring at her very, very intensely.

!DOCTOR KENNER (CONT’D)

!I...

Martha leaps to her feet, grabbing a vase off the table next

to the couch and hurling it at the wall next to Doctor

Kenner.

MARTHA

!YOU MOTHERFU-

TRANSITION FROM THE EXPLODING

!VASE INTO AN EXPLODING CAR .

!TITLE: MR. RIGHT.

The opening credits are juxtaposed with two different

processes: the factory production of bullets and prescription

antidepressants/ antipsychotics.

!COME BACK IN ON...

EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

It’s a lot on the edge of the city, barely lit.  The burning

car sits in the center, and two other men stand a couple

dozen feet away, by another car.

VON Cartigan , late 30s , well dressed and handsome, with a

spry, boyish look about him and cowboy boots, stands counting

money in a briefcase on the trunk of the car.

JOHNNY HOWL , stocky, 40s , with an eerie jack-o-lantern face,

stands watching the car burn.  Von looks at the money and

tips his head to the side, thinking.

!CON TINUE D:

!(CO NTINU ED)

VON

You think that was too much?

JOHNNY HOWL

It’s never too much, Von.

VON

Seemed a mite excessive, with his kid in

the car.

JOHNNY HOWL

He shouldn’t have brought his kid.

VON

So it’s acceptable losses?

JOHNNY HOWL

(beat)

Yeah.

Von closes the briefcase.

VON

You’re a sick fuck , Johnny Howl.

JOHNNY HOWL

(beat)

Yeah.

Von pops the trunk, and starts to put in the briefcase.

!JOHNNY HOWL (CONT'D)

Hey Von.

Von looks up, and Johnny nods at a badly burnt man, who’s

crawling away from the car.  Von laughs, and closes the

trunk, then heads over to the crawling man.

VON

Hello down there, Buddy.  Rough night?

The man lets out a hissing sound.

Von stomps repeatedly on the back of the man’s knees with

harsh cracking sounds.  Von stops, and takes a breath.

!VON (CONT'D)

Don’t crawl, Buddy, it’s undignified.

(beat, then takes a moment, and

smiles at Johnny)

Johnny , help me put him back in the car.

The man lets out a horrified groan as Johnny Howl approaches,

smiling.

TRANSITION THE GROANING INTO

!THE BEEPING OF AN ALARM CLOCK.

INT. MARTHA’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM

Martha’s alarm is going off, but her bed is empty.  The room

is a mess, clothes everywhere, dirty glasses strewn here and

there. There is a diorama of the primeval world, old and

tattered, spread across the wall, and a single wooden

sculpture of a pterodactyl hanging from the ceiling.

ELAINE Schiff , early 30s , tall and wiry, peeks in.

ELAINE

Martha, are you...

Elaine comes into the room, looking around.  There’s a loud

thump from inside the closed closet.

!MARTHA (O.S.)

(muffled)

Shut up!

Elaine looks concerned.

INT. MARTHA’S APARTMENT - HALLWAY - LATER

Elaine walks along, leading TATIANA Ruiz , early 30s , Cuban,

stout but pretty.

ELAINE

It’s as bad as I’ve seen her, Tati.

TATIANA

Where is she now?

INT. MARTHA’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Elaine and Tatiana come in.

ELAINE

She’s drunk in the closet again.

There’s a crashing sound from the closet. Tatiana sighs, and

goes over to the door.

TATIANA

Martha?  Are you okay in there?

!MARTHA (O.S.)

Amflegblamersh!  JIHHHH!

Tatiana looks to Elaine, who makes a “ yikes ” face.

!CON TINUE D:

!(CO NTINU ED)

TATIANA

I want to come in.  Can I come in?

MARTHA

(inhuman demonic screaming)

NoOoooOOOOOooooOoooo!

Tatiana opens the door, revealing Martha laying in a pile of

fallen jackets, shirts and dresses.  The closet is a wreck.

TATIANA

(concerned)

Oh Martha...What is this?

MARTHA

I’ve only been drinking for three...Days,

but I haven’t missed work.  I have missed

work.

Tatiana kneels down next to Martha.

TATIANA

Come on, honey, let’s-

MARTHA

I think you don’t know anything about

this situation, you don’t know anything

about the world...I’m gonna PUNCH YOU IN

THE FACE...yourself...You better check

yourself...

Tatiana helps Martha up, near to against her will.

TATIANA

Elaine give me a hand.

MARTHA

(muttering)

Checkyoself into a hospital...emergency

room...after I mega...

ELAINE

I’m not touching her, she’s all...sticky.

MARTHA

(muttering)

...mega-punch...

Martha collapses onto the floor.

!CON TINUE D:

INT. MARTHA’S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - SHORTLY THEREAFTER

Martha’s bathroom is strictly whites and purples.  She stands

staring at herself in the mirror, squinting her eyes very

hard, then staring again.  She’s rocking in place a little.

MARTHA

(quietly)

Goddamn it.

Martha brushes back her hair, and then stops, holding it

back.  She brushes the other side back, and then holds it up.

She cocks her head, looking at herself.

She opens a drawer, revealing a pair of electric clippers.

EXT. METROPOLITAN STREET - LATE AFTERNOON

Mr. RIGHT , 30, handsome with wavy, messy brown hair, walks up

the street.  He has a lighter-than-air, poppy, bubbly air

about him, as though he just walked out of a musical comedy.

He is constantly looking around, smiling blissfully and

blankly at everything.

Right stops in front of a tall building, checks the address,

grins and goes in.

We stay there on the lobby, and then shoot up the side of the

building around twenty stories, and stop at a window into a

nice apartment.

A well dressed woman answers the door; it’s Right.  He

smiles, and they exchange words as he goes in.  She looks

very serious.  Mr. Right looks hesitant.  He seems to

repeatedly, incredulous but friendly, ask the same question.

The woman fervently nods.

Mr. Right shrugs, pulls a red foam clown nose out of his

pocket, puts it on, draws out a pistol and shoots her in the

heart. She falls down against the wall, startled.

Right takes a contemplative bite of out a Rice-Krispie treat.

EXT. MARTHA’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM

Elaine is cleaning, while Tatianna talks on the phone.  It’s

getting dark outside.  Martha abruptly bursts out of the

bathroom; we see Elaine and Tatianna react sharply.

Martha has cut off a good 85% of her hair.  Martha tosses

Elaine a pair of car keys.

MARTHA

Heads up.

!(CO NTINU ED)

The keys smack Elaine in the face, and she gasps, holding her

eye.

TATIANA

Martha, jesus christ.

MARTHA

I thought she would catch it with her mad

(skills. beat , leans back)

But, I guess she just kinda sucks.  We’re

going out, right?  We’re going out.

INT. BAR - NIGHT

The place is a little crowded; Elaine and Tatianna are at the

bar, they look nervous.  Martha comes up, holding drinks; one

of the cups is empty, which she hands to Tatiana.

MARTHA

Hellloooo laaaadddiieeesss.

TATIANA

(to her empty cup)

What the hell is this?

MARTHA

Well, it was supposed to be a sex on the

beach but I drank it, so now it’s just a

cup.

TATIANA

Jesus christ , Martha.

MARTHA

(excited, looking around)

Oh, is he here?

Martha separates from her friends, and goes off to dance.

Out on the dance floor, Martha appears to be having a good

time dancing alone, when SOME GUY , mid-20s , reasonably

attractive, approaches.

SOME GUY

Hey!

MARTHA

(smiles)

Hey!

SOME GUY

Who are you here with?

!CON TINUE D:

!(CO NTINU ED)

MARTHA

My friends.

SOME GUY

(laughs)

No boyfriend?

Martha abruptly stops dancing.

MARTHA

My boyfriend was killed by velociraptors.

SOME GUY

(What? beat)

Was that a joke?

Martha looks very sad.

!SOME GUY (CONT’D)

No, come on, it’s joke.

Martha has started to cry.

!SOME GUY (CONT’D)

Don’t do that...It was a joke...Don’t...

Some Guy awkwardly moves back into the crowd, and Martha

snickers, wiping her eyes.

CUT TO: THE GIRLS HEADING UP

THE STREET

EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT - LATER

Martha, Tatianna and Elaine walk up the road.

MARTHA

That was incredible!

ELAINE

How was that incredible?

MARTHA

It’s been forever since I’ve just been,

you know, out like that, not trying to

get laid.

ELAINE

You’re lucky we love you, Martie.

MARTHA

Yes I am! Hey, hoes before bros , right?

!CON TINUE D:

!(CO NTINU ED)

Martha offers out a fist.

!MARTHA (CONT’D)

Right?  Am I right?

TATIANA

You’re out of control, girl.  You are out

of control.

A car blurs by and we

SWISH PAN TO:

EXT. CITY ZOO - NIGHT

In the near empty parking lot of a city zoo, a single

expensive towncar sits alone, lights off, with heavily tinted

windows.  A dozen feet or so away from the car stands SHOTGUN

STEVE Gage , late 20s , with a sly, wiry look about him, almost

like a human coyote.  He lights a cigarette.

Directly outside the car is BRUCE Cooper , 30s , black, lean

and well dressed.  He’s trying to calm down CHARLIE Cartigan ,

who looks incensed.

CHARLIE

Dead!?  What the fuck do you mean, dead?

BRUCE

If you’d just get in the car, Mr.

Cartigan , we could-

CHARLIE

Fuck you, I’m not getting in the car,

this ain’t a fuckin’ meet.  If you want

to wake a man up at three in the fuck AM

you best have some kind of explanation,

better than “ Minkin is dead,” I don’t

care who the fuck my nephews think they

are-

The driver’s side window rolls down, revealing RICHARD

Cartigan , 42, bearing a distinct resemblance his brother Von,

and clearly trying to look dignified.

RICHARD

Charlie, get in the car.

CHARLIE

What’re we doing here, Richard-

RICHARD

Get in the car.

!CON TINUE D:

!(CO NTINU ED)

CHARLIE

Yeah, okay.

The back door opens, and Richard gets in.  Richard looks to

Bruce, who rolls his eyes.  Richard smiles, and rolls up the

window.

!INSIDE THE CAR:

Charlie gets in the back, looking around.  Von sits in the

passenger’s side, and Johnny Howl sits in the back, playing

with a Rubik’s cube.  They all look nervous.  There’s a

charged silence.

!CHARLIE (CONT’D)

(What is this? referencing Johnny Howl)

What’s this ghoul doing here?

VON

We have a problem.

CHARLIE

Yeah, so I’ve fuckin’ heard, but it can’t

wait till morning-

VON

It might be my fault.

CHARLIE

(exasperated)

Are the Picolos involved in this? I

thought they were all dead-

VON

No, but it’s very, very serious.

RICHARD

So serious that we all might be in

danger.

Everyone’s quiet for a moment.  Johnny Howl grins.

CHARLIE

What did you do, Von?

Von’s silent.

!CHARLIE (CONT’D)

(disgusted)

You fuckin’ kids, playing at being

gangsters-

!CON TINUE D:

!(CO NTINU ED)

RICHARD

Von took someone out, one of Yatsuda’s

guys, and it looks like Yatsuda isn’t

taking it well.

CHARLIE

Why the fuck would you start shit with

Bobby Yatsuda , are you fuckin’ suicidal?

VON

He shitted us out on cash, Uncle Charlie.

The dumbfuck shitted us out, big time, we

couldn’t just let it stand.

CHARLIE

Fuckin’ drugs?  This was over fuckin’

drugs again?

VON

Well-

RICHARD

It doesn’t matter what it was over.

CHARLIE

No, I suppose it wouldn’t to you, would

it.  You know, Rich, I woulda seen this

dumb shit coming from Von, I really would

have.  But you?  Is this where you’re

going too, with this garbage-

RICHARD

It doesn’t matter, Charlie, what matters

is that we’re targets now.  Von says he’s

got some guys who can take care of this

for us.

CHARLIE

“Take care” of Bobby Yatsuda? Are

you both out of your fucking minds?

VON

Show him the list, Johnny.

Johnny takes out a rumpled list of phone numbers, handing it

over to Charlie.

CHARLIE

What’s this?

VON

It’s a list I made up; those are the

numbers of the best trigger guys in the

city.

!CON TINUE D:

!(CO NTINU ED)

CHARLIE

What, we’re going to get some Slovakian

douchebag to take down Bobby Yatsuda-

VON

No, no, these aren’t thugs, man. These

are the real deal, hitmen.

CHARLIE

Hitmen?  Shit , you guys are...Man, I

ain’t heard someone talking about hiring

a real gun since the seventies.

VON

Some of the numbers might not work,

but if you can get a guy, then-

CHARLIE

Why me?

RICHARD

The way Von figures it we’ve got a better

chance of getting quality if we use you.

No one gives a shit about Dickie and Von

Cartigan , but Charles Cartigan , the

Hammer, you’re a name.

Charlie stares at the list.

CHARLIE

You kids are really for real about this.

Von looks nervously at Richard.

RICHARD

The way I see it, Von hasn’t left us much

of a choice.

Charlie stares at the list.

EXT. PETACULAR! - MORNING

It’s a petshop in a strip mall.  There’s a loud shattering

sound.

CUT TO: A FURIOUS CAT’S

!SNARLING FACE.

INT. PETACULAR! - KENNEL - CONTINUOUS

In the kennel in the back of the store, a single longhair

cat, deranged with fear and anger, has escaped from its

carrier and knocked over a glass-fronted cabinet.

!CON TINUE D:

!(CO NTINU ED)

It sits in the center of the room, roaring furiously at

Martha and Elaine, now dressed in work clothes, who stand

facing it.

ELAINE

Isn’t it supposed to find a corner?

MARTHA

No, he wants to throwdown.

ELAINE

Cats aren’t supposed to throw down!

The cat screams.

MARTHA

He wants to throw down pound for pound

like we were clowns that tried to mess

around.

ELAINE

What?

MARTHA

Gimme the net.

Elaine gets a short-handled net from off a counter, and

tosses it to Martha.

ELAINE

He’ll just run.

MARTHA

He wants to take me on, you want to take

me on, come on ese I’ll cut you up!

The cat screams with the fury of hell.

!MARTHA (CONT'D)

Oh you talk a big game now but not so big

(when I make you my bitch. to Elaine)

Go around back of him, startle him

towards me.

Elaine nods, and goes around back of the cat.  Martha and the

cat lock eyes, and then Elaine jumps towards the cat.

ELAINE

Boo!

The cat turns and pounces onto her face.

!CON TINUE D:

Oh shit!

CUT TO: MARTHA AND ELAINE

SITTING TOGETHER OUTSIDE

EXT. PETACULAR! - SHORTLY THEREAFTER

Both women are sitting, covered in little bloody scratches

and liquid cat diarrhea.  Elaine is smoking a cigarette.

ELAINE

(continuing her thought)

It just exploded.

MARTHA

Like a burst fire hydrant of cat shit ,

that was unreal.

ELAINE

Do you think that’s a defense mechanism,

or-

MARTHA

I think he was just that scared of us.

We’re really hardcore.

ELAINE

How bad is the one on my elbow?

MARTHA

Oof. Bad.  See this is why I’m never

gonna be a lesbian.

Elaine looks at her, confused.

!MARTHA (CONT’D)

Pussy is crazy dangerous .

Elaine sits in silence, and then starts laughing.

ELAINE

You are, I think, actually retarded-

MARTHA

(standing up)

Yeah yeah, I’ma hit the drugstore.

Martha heads off.

!CON TINUE D:

ELAINE

You’re covered in blood and cat shit!

MARTHA

(from further yet away)

I know.

INT. DRUG STORE

Martha is waiting in line at the pharmacy, staring at a big

“The Bahamas: Rediscover Love!  Rediscover Life!” banner up

on the wall.

Mr. Right sits off to the side in the waiting area.  He’s

staring intently at his hands.  People are kind of shying

away from Martha, due to the smell and appearance, causing

Right to notice her as she approaches the counter.

PHARMACIST

Name please?

MARTHA

Martha McKay.

PHARMACIST

Meflem?

MARTHA

Mick-AY.

PHARMACIST

Oh, yes.

The pharmacist goes back to the medications.  Martha glances

around, noticing Mr. Right STARING at her.  Martha picks up

her birth control, and turns, heading away from the pharmacy.

She glances back to Right, but he’s gone.

She looks down, a little glum, and walks directly into a

display of cough-drops; boxes scatter and fall in all

directions.

We see Martha’s POV , slow motion; as one of the boxes falls,

we see a dotted line draw out, predicting where it’s headed.

Martha begins to reach out towards it.

!FREEZE.

!CON TINUE D:

!(CO NTINU ED)

Suddenly, every single falling box grows a prediction line.

!UNFREEZE.

Martha catches the single box, but no other boxes fall.  She

looks up to see Mr. Right, holding all of the boxes.  He

looks earnestly cautious, as though he may have just violated

a boundary.

MARTHA

(quietly)

How did you do that.

RIGHT

(nods at the single box

she holds)

How did you do that?

Martha stands silently for a moment.  Right casually takes

the box from her, and replaces them all on the display.  She

notices Right staring at her again.

MARTHA

It was a cat.

RIGHT

What?

MARTHA

A cat, did this.

RIGHT

Did what?

Martha blinks, staring at him.

!RIGHT (CONT'D)

You want a lifesaver?

Martha looks at him quizzically.

!RIGHT (CONT’D)

(reflective)

I like lifesavers very much.

MARTHA

(beat)

Do those work?

Right just looks bewildered.

!CON TINUE D:

!(CO NTINU ED)

!MARTHA (CONT’D)

“ Ooh , I’m nice lifesaver guy, you’re

clumsy and vulnerable, look how handsome

I am.”  Do you have a secret stock of

lifesaver based jokes?  Do you buy them

in bulk?

Right stares at her emptily.

RIGHT

(blankly, as though by rote)

I like lifesavers very much.

Martha tries to move past him, and he blocks her way.  Martha

takes a step back, reevaluating the situation.

!RIGHT (CONT’D)

Is that creepy?  Sometimes I don’t

know when I’m being creepy.

Right moves aside.

!RIGHT (CONT’D)

I get too forward, and then-

MARTHA

Who...are you?

RIGHT

Should I give you a fake name or my

real one?

Martha stares at him.

MARTHA

Fake name.

RIGHT

Hubert Cumberbund.

MARTHA

“Hubert Cumberbund. ”

RIGHT

My friends call me Huey.

Martha stares at him for a moment more and then laughs.

MARTHA

I can’t believe I’m talking to you, Huey.

MARTHA

(laughs again)

You are just...Why are you here?

RIGHT

(chipper)

I need my prescriptions so I don’t feel

angry all the time.

MARTHA

I don’t think any one’s ever used that as

pick-up line before.

RIGHT

(looks around, then

whispers confidentially)

Is it working?

MARTHA

(laughing and vehemently

shaking her head)

No, no it isn’t.

RIGHT

I’m sorry, it’s the best I’ve got.  I’m

not very suave.

MARTHA

Oh really?

RIGHT

No, not really, actually I am very suave.

MARTHA

(beat)

Okay, explain why I should “hang out”

with you in two words.

RIGHT

(beat)

“Or else?”

Martha stares at him, and then Right winks at her, and she

starts laughing.  Right notices the circular box Martha is

holding.

(Oh, are those birth control? beat)

Awesome .

EXT. FAST FOOD RESTAURANT - LATER

Martha and Right sit together on the ground against the side

of the restaurant.  Both of them have kids’ meals in colorful

cardboard containers, which they are opening.

RIGHT

What’d you get, what’d you get?

MARTHA

Hold on, hold on...

(takes out her toy)

Green Parrot. What’d you get?

RIGHT

Dog with Spot.  Dog With Spot beats Green

Parrot.

MARTHA

(What?  No way.  Green Parrot can fly. beat)

Plus, he had this really bad childhood,

so now he carries a knife with him

everywhere.

Right laughs.

!MARTHA (CONT’D)

His parole officer tries to send him in

the right direction, but Green Parrot is

just too...

(laughs)

What about Dog with Spot?

RIGHT

(shakes his head sadly)

He had so much promise, but dropped out

of college, lives with his girlfriend,

she supports him...Not a pretty story,

really.

MARTHA

Is this story indicative of you, or-

RIGHT

No, nah. So you were telling me about

the museum?

MARTHA

Right, worked there for two years, and

now, back to the petstore.

RIGHT

Wait, back to Petacular with Elaine?

!(CO NTINU ED)

MARTHA

Thus the cat shit , yes.

RIGHT

But I thought you said you were going to

end up managing the Egyptian thing-

MARTHA

Right, I was, but I’m...People have

trouble working with me.

RIGHT

Yeah?  You’re a troublemaker?

MARTHA

(grins)

No, I just...I have some “restraint

issues.”  I’m kind of impulsive.

RIGHT

I find that really attractive.

MARTHA

Oh, you wouldn’t if you knew me.

RIGHT

I’m impulsive too.

MARTHA

(beat)

What do you do , exactly?

RIGHT

I sell cars, and I kill people.

MARTHA

Oh, you split the time?

RIGHT

INT. PETACULAR!

Elaine stands alone behind the counter. She looks around,

and then looks at the clock on the wall.

EXT. LAKE SIDE PARK - TWILIGHT

Martha and Right walk along the edge of an urban lake,

laughing.

RIGHT

Dragons?

!CON TINUE D:

!(CO NTINU ED)

MARTHA

Yeah dragons.  Humans put names on

everything to make them safe, but

when you come down to it, a whale

is just a sea monster, right?  I

mean, what’s a dinosaur other than

a dragon?

As Martha talks, an errant frisbee nearly hits Right;

seemingly without even looking, he catches it and throws it

back.

!MARTHA (CONT’D)

People see things and they put

labels on them, and it takes

the...The whatever, the wonder out.

It allows people to just glance at

stuff instead of really looking.

RIGHT

People prefer that, I think.  Most

people live in little contained

worlds; they like a T-Rex better as

a big bunch of bones than as

something that actually lived.

MARTHA

Yeah, maybe.  That’s why I got into

paleontology in the first place,

because I wanted to show the past

to people in a new way.  I thought

by now I’d be working in the

Smithsonian , but I can’t...

RIGHT

Impulsive, right.

MARTHA

(Right. beat)

We haven’t really, yknow , talked about

you much.

RIGHT

Well that’s a shame, because I’m

early twenties, latina , sexy, who stands with her friends

around a picnic table in the park.

INT. CHARLIE CARTIGAN’S PLACE - LIVING ROOM

Charlie Cartigan sits alone in his living room, staring at

the crumpled list Von gave him.  He sighs, and dials one of

again disconnected.

Charlie’s on the phone with Von.  We intercut back and forth

to Von, who’s in an ARCADE playing a stand-up video game

while Johnny Howl sits on a pinball machine behind him.

CHARLIE

The numbers don’t work.

VON

How many did you try?

CHARLIE

I tried six, they’re all disconnected-

VON

Well I told you some of them wouldn’t

work, Uncle Charlie, you’ve just gotta go

Well what was I supposed to do, call and

good way to get myself shot-

Von dies in the game, causing Johnny Howl to chuckle.

!VON (CONT’D)

Agh , goddamnit!

CHARLIE

(concerned)

You okay?

VON

Look, I’m fine, Charlie, and I’m sorry

about the numbers, but just please, do

your best, okay?

Von hangs up as a big, bulky ARCADE EMPLOYEE comes up to

Johnny Howl.

ARCADE EMPLOYEE

Hey, man, please don’t sit on the

machines.

Johnny Howl looks to Von.

VON

Yeah, I’m done anyway.

Johnny Howl abruptly spins around behind the bulky guy, and

instantly slits his throat with a straight razor.

Blood splatters onto the pinball machine, and the man falls

behind it.  It all happened so fast, no one in the arcade

even noticed.  Von chuckles.

Mr. Right and Martha are posted out down by the water,

Right’s cell phone rings, and he flips it open.

MARTHA

Anyone interesting?

RIGHT

Probably not.

Right flips the cell phone closed again.

!RIGHT (CONT'D)

I’ve never, I don’t think I’ve ever seen

a woman throw punches like that before.

MARTHA

Yeah, well, she escaped, so mission

failure, I think.

She was one of the girls sleeping with...

See, I think my problem has always been

that if you want someone, really want

them, you’ve got to know immediately and

stick by it. Recently, I don’t want to

throw myself out there for anyone to pick

up.  I’ve just been trying to take life

more seriously, you know?

Martha looks up, and gasps, then laughs; Mr. Right has put on

the red foam clown nose.

He takes it off, pocketing it.

MARTHA

The corniest guy alive.

RIGHT

It’s possible.

MARTHA

So, are you against casual sex, then?

RIGHT

I don’t think I’ve ever had sex that

wasn’t casual; I mean, I usually do it

naked, so what’s more casual than that.

Martha laughs.

!RIGHT (CONT’D)

I was dating a girl, for a while, and we

were having formal sex; I had to wear a

tuxedo.  It was really sweaty-

Martha keeps laughing.

!RIGHT (CONT’D)

And I dated a girl where we had, like,

semi-formal sex; I had to wear a button

Elaine stares at him.

Elaine quietly goes back into her room, shutting the door.

She opens the door again for a moment, staring at him. Mr.

Right sort of shrugs.

!THROUGH THE CHANNELS.

INT. MARTHA’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM

The lights are off.  Mr. Right lays on the bed, shoes and

socks off, flipping through the channels. He stops, staring

at the diorama on the wall.

Martha comes out of the bathroom in a towel, with a towel

around her hair.  She notices Right staring at the diorama,

and looks at him questioningly.

Martha has to stop a frighteningly big smile, and then covers

her face, slightly embarrassed.

Across the street on the roof of a building, Agent Bart

HOPPER , 54, with a widows peak, looks down at Martha’s window

through binoculars.

Next to him, Agent WALLY Kinokis , 30, gruff looking, pops

open a pack of nicotine gum.  Both of them, from their

clothes to their posture, read as FBI.

Nope.

INT. MARTHA’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - MORNING

Martha lays asleep, alone, in bed; her towel has come mostly

unwrapped, and we can see her bare back and a little bit of

her butt.  She blinks, awaking and realizing she’s alone, and

then notices a note on her bed.

Drawn on it is a simple, childlike image of Martha fighting a

cat like a lion tamer, with stiff block letters under it.  “I

HAVE TO GO TO WORK.  I WILL SEE YOU TONIGHT.”  She stares at

it for a moment, and then slowly allows herself to smile.

INT. CAR DEALERSHIP - RIGHT’S OFFICE

Right sits at his desk, talking on the phone, looking out the

window.  The nameplate reads “Clark Speck.”  There’s a wind

up toy on his desk, wandering along.

RIGHT

I see them, I do, but you have to

understand, when I say we can’t move

Someone walks by, and he covers the phone, calling out to

them.

The man stops and looks into the office.

!RIGHT (CONT’D)

I’m in love!

Mitch shrugs, and keeps walking.  Right goes back to the

phone.

!RIGHT (CONT’D)

Look, I’ll get back to you about

Mr. Right hangs up, and sits for a moment, and then takes out

Mr. Right sits in a storage container, wearing only an

undershirt and underwear.  On a crate in front of him he’s

laid out a dozen different types of pistols, and he’s looking

over them, thinking.  His face is dead and emotionless.

We pan to reveal that the wall behind him is covered with

guns; it is not, however, simply an armory.  There is only

one gun of each type; one sniper rifle, one combat rifle, one

submachine gun, etc.  What we’re looking at isn’t an arsenal;

it’s a toolbox.

His cell phone rings, and he takes it out.  It reads “Martha

RIGHT

I want to come around-

MARTHA

No, I...I think you should definitely do

that.  Break the face to face code of

next to her.  The food arrives, and the confused waiter puts

the plates down in front of them.

Right’s apartment is primarily decorated in greens, tasteful,

very organized, minimalist.  Martha sits on his couch,

looking around.  Right is in the kitchen, making hot

chocolate.

the hot chocolate)

Right comes over to her, and hands her her mug of hot

chocolate.

RIGHT

The truth is, I don’t really like my

name.  I kind of hate it.  Even hearing

it makes me kind of angry, I...I have a

lot of anger about a lot of things.  I’m

kind of messed up in a lot of ways.  I’ve

been completely honest with you about

everything, it’s only two days in so I

know that’s not a big accomplishment or

something, but I just...I really don’t

like my name.  I don’t want to tell you

It’s a little later, and Martha and Right now stand next to

his table.  Martha looks a little apprehensive.

A quick montage of Martha playing with knives in various

locations; frightening Tatianna , twirling them clumsily in

front of a mirror, running one up her arm and getting the

shivers, violently and theatrically slicing an onion “ HIYA!

running holding a bunch of knives yelling “ I GOT KNIFES FO

It’s slightly later; Right and Martha are nearer to the

center of the room.  Right stands behind their bodies pressed

together, limbs moving slowly, synchronized, just an easy,

gradual dance.  As they move, Right talks.

!RIGHT (CONT’D)

Ever since I was a little boy, I’ve

had an idea.  It’s a theory.

(he leans back, forcing

her to lay back on him,

and runs her own hands up

her body)

Keep up.

MARTHA

(trying to keep her

balance)

I’m trying.

RIGHT

Everything we see, like physical

things, it’s all just islands.  And

under it, carrying it, is this

sweeping current.

He brings their right hands up in front of Martha’s face, and

moves it fluidly back and forth.

!RIGHT (CONT’D)

And if you pay attention, you can

start to feel it.  Here, you see

how your hand moves with mine?  You

can feel it.  You can feel it

through me.  Do you feel it?

Martha’s quiet as they move, trying to figure out if this is

just foreplay, or if that strange sensation she’s feeling

counts at what Right is talking about.  He subtly grabs a

knife off the table with his left hand, and then continues

moving, bringing the knife dangerously close to her throat.

!CON TINUE D:

at the knife)

It’s okay, just concentrate on the

Now if we can feel the current, we

can feel other things in the

current, other moving things,

people...watch the knife...And we

can feel how the current will move

them, and we can see where they’ll

go.  It’s all in the movement, see,

it pushes itself; it’s easier to

move with it than against it.

Martha’s gaze moves from knife to Right’s arm, and, very

faintly, we see the dotted trace lines from his shoulder, his

elbow, his wrist and the tip of the knife.  Right, staring at

Martha, watching her face, abruptly drops the knife, bringing

his and her other hands directly under it.

Martha yelps and jumps away, and Right easily catches knife.

MARTHA

Jesus christ!

RIGHT

What?

MARTHA

Why the fuck would you-

RIGHT

I thought you would catch it.

MARTHA

Catch it, jesus-

(suddenly concerned and

apologetic)

where it was going to go?

Look, um , I had a really nice

her.

Time stops for a second, Martha’s eyes wide, staring at the

knife as it spins towards her.

Martha’s hand shoots up and plucks the knife out of the air ,

holding it by the blade.  There’s absolute stillness, with

Right realizing he just went way over the line to prove his

point.

Luckily, Martha is sprinting past that line as well.  She

lets out short, deep, throaty “ hur-hur-hur ” laugh, staring at

the knife.

MARTHA

(whispering)

That’s so gnarly-

Mr. Right tosses another knife at her, and Martha catches it

almost without looking.

!MARTHA (CONT’D)

No, no more, okay, it...I get it.

RIGHT

Gimme one of those back.

Martha throws a knife to Right, which he easily catches,

spins, and whips back at her, along with a second knife.  She

throws the first knife at Right , and then catches both new

knives, and then has to catch the first knife as Right tosses

it back at her.

She stares at the three knives in her hands as Right

approaches.

MARTHA

It’s like a...Like a pulse?

RIGHT

Like everything is on strings,

could know.  You’re the one that

Right pulls up, and parks.  Out on a park bench sits Charlie

Cartigan , but otherwise, the park is entirely empty.  Charlie

fidgets nervously, waiting, holding a plastic bag.

RIGHT

There’s my guy.  I’ll be right back,

okay?

MARTHA

Okay.

Mr. Right leans over and kisses her.  He then gets out, and

heads off towards Charlie.  Martha sits in silence for a

moment, and then turns on the radio; it’s a pop love song.

She changes, it, country.  Changes it again, and comes onto

heavy, bass-thumping, hardcore rap.

Martha smiles and calmly lip-syncs the words.

Martha watches from the car as Right and Charlie stand up and

shake hands.

Mr. Right then puts on the clown nose.  Charlie looks

confused.

Mr. Right suddenly drops a gun out of his sleeve and shoots

Charlie through the side of the face .  Martha gasps, her eyes

wide.  Right catches Charlie as he falls forward, and we can

see him saying “Oh, shit , sorry.”

Right apologetically gives the horrified Martha a “one

second” finger, shrugs and mouths the word “sorry.”

Charlie tries to draw his gun, and Right abruptly shoots him

in the forehead , then turns and briskly starts walking back

to the car.  Charlie’s body falls dead.

nothing to do with how I feel about you.

Martha drops eye contact.  Right sighs, and puts the car in

gear.

They drive out of the parking lot, and we hold on the empty

park.  We pan to reveal Johnny Howl, sitting in a innocuous

sedan.  He stares at the body of Charlie Cartigan in silence;

his reaction is unreadable.

He sighs, blowing out smoke and then tosses out his

cigarette, and starts the car.

EXT. MARTHA’S APARTMENT - STREET LEVEL

Right pulls up, letting Martha out.  She immediately goes up

the stairs, but he gets out.

RIGHT

Martha, wait.

Martha stops on the stoop, and turns around.

!RIGHT (CONT’D)

I don’t...I’m not a bad person.  I don’t

think before I act sometimes, but...I

love you, and I’m not a bad person.

Martha slowly nods, and goes inside.  Right sighs, and kicks

the car, and then gets in and drives away.  Across the

street, in an alley, Johnny Howl watches the building.

INT. MARTHA’S APARTMENT - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Martha comes in, closes the door, leans and then slumps

against it, staring straight ahead.  We see her view of the

apartment, empty and hostile. Busta , her cat, meows,

approaching.

She slowly pets the cat, staring blankly at anything and

everything.  She walks over to the window, and closes the

shades.

INT. RICHARD’S OFFICE

It’s a plush office, in an office building.  Johnny Howl

stands across a desk from Richard, who’s seated, on the edge

of either tears or an explosive outburst.  Von leans against

the wall; he looks shocked and horrified.  Bruce stands

behind Richard, listening.

RICHARD

I don’t...understand.

JOHNNY HOWL

The guy just walked up and shot him, like

that.  Nothing to it.  I don’t see what

He’s Bobby fucking Yatsuda-

RICHARD

And I’m Richard Fucking Cartigan , who the

back to us from the Picolos.

Von looks hurt.

BRUCE

Why would Yatsuda hire a contractor?

I mean, we haven’t felt any backlash from

Yatsuda himself, why would he hire some

random gun to take out-

Bruce looks annoyed, and Richard sits, thinking.

That’s his job, that’s his girlfriend.

BRUCE

His girlfriend?

RICHARD

Get some guys.  Take him out. Tonight .

Do it.

Von and Johnny briefly make eye contact, and then Johnny

nods.

INT. MARTHA’S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - LATER

Martha sits on her toilet, not moving.  There’s a knock at

the door, which she ignores.  Another knock, harder.

Elaine hurries up, eating yogurt, and answers the door. Agent

Hopper and Agent Kinokis stand waiting.  Hopper raises his

badge.

Johnny Howl is handing out guns and ammunition to three guys,

SAW , who holds a massive Madsen machine gun, UZI , who holds

an Uzi , and Shotgun Steve, who’s been given an ancient Parker

shotgun. ZEKE , late 20s , with spiked hair, a collared shirt

and a better than you attitude, stands by in the background.

SHOTGUN STEVE

What the fuck am I supposed to do with

this?

JOHNNY HOWL

Shoot him.

SHOTGUN STEVE

This thing is from like world war fucking

to go out fucking duck hunting-

JOHNNY HOWL

Look, we’re hitting him at his straight

INT. MARTHA’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM

Martha sits motionless at a eaves-table; Elaine is pacing

behind her, looking shaky.  Hopper is seated across from her,

and Wally stands behind him; Hopper’s open briefcase sits on

a chair next to him.

MARTHA

He’s...he’s not a bad person.

Hopper laughs.

ELAINE

You don’t even know what he is, who he is-

HOPPER

(interrupting her)

His name is Francis Minch.  He’s a

psychopath.

Hopper spreads some photos out on the table, mugshots , news

photographs of assassinations.

!HOPPER (CONT'D)

He was formerly one of the world’s most

notorious professional killers.  He had

been ever since he was a teenager, just a

kind of meat-grinder of a man.  But then,

about a year ago, he had a nervous

breakdown and quit.

ELAINE

Why?

WALLY

(cutting off Hopper)

He’s a psychopath, not a sociopath.  The

guy has emotions.  He has guilt.  They’re

just operating on a real low level, and

his “feelings” just finally caught up

(with him. beat , a look from Hopper)

That’s the theory, anyway.

MARTHA

(quietly)

Then what was today?

HOPPER

What?

MARTHA

If he’s not a hitman anymore, why did he

kill that man in the park?

!(CO NTINU ED)

After a beat, Hopper smiles an odd smile.

HOPPER

After the breakdown, Minch developed a

kind of moral code.  He’s still

notorious.  People still try to hire him.

But now, he kills them.

ELAINE

He kills the people who hire him?

HOPPER

That’s right.

WALLY

Because “murder” is wrong.

ELAINE

That’s insane.

HOPPER

So is Francis Minch.

Martha and Elaine are silent.

ELAINE

Just how dangerous is he?

HOPPER

Oh, there’s no kind of chart. Minch

isn’t some kind of superhero, he’s as

human as you and me, he’s just... He’s

just frighteningly efficient.  He dances

(in, kills everyone, and dances out. to himself, ponderous)

It’s kind of beautiful, really.

A long beat.  Martha and Hopper have made eye contact, and

there’s an odd kind of understanding.  Elaine and Wally look

distinctly non-plussed.

MARTHA

(quietly)

So what now.

HOPPER

(standing)

The man you witnessed him killing today

was heavily involved in organized crime.

We should expect retribution.  We’re

arranging a safe-house for you; until

then, we’re putting this apartment under

protection.

Martha just sits there, still shell-shocked.

HOPPER

Right.  She’s got it.

Martha stares at nothing.

EXT. CAR DEALERSHIP - NIGHT

Mr. Right is locking up, and waving goodbye to coworkers as

they leave.  He begins to walk alone through the lot, and

then takes out his cell phone, dialing Martha.

CUT TO: MARTHA STARING NUMBLY

!AT HER PHONE.

It reads MR.RIGHT. She lets it ring, near tears.

BACK TO: RIGHT IN THE LOT

Right sighs, pocketing his phone, and then stops.  We see the

way he views the world; everything in the lot seems to vanish

piece by piece, leaving the Shotgun Steve, Uzi and SAW headed

across the lot towards him, moving in a void.

Everything comes back, and Right stares at them, not moving.

Uzi opens fire, blasting the car Right stands next to, and

keeps shooting.  The windows shatter and the car’s alarm goes

off.

Right, either knowing that he’s beyond Uzi’s ability to aim

with any kind of accuracy or simply not caring, continues to

look vacantly at the trio of men; “Oh?”.

He puts on the clown nose.

Steve shoves down Uzi’s gun by the barrel, burning his hand.

SHOTGUN STEVE

Agh , shit , STOP FUCKING SHOOTING!

Right crouches down, and slowly, carefully starts squat-

walking through the row of cars.  He looks agitated, but not

scared or nervous.

Out in the circle, Shotgun Steve, Uzi and SAW look around

very quietly.  The car alarm screams in the night.

!CON TINUE D:

SAW

Where’d he go?

SHOTGUN STEVE

(quietly)

God fucking damn it, why did you start

shooting-

UZI

Shut up, pussy, I didn’t see you doing

jack shit and-

Shotgun Steve abruptly raises his hand.

SHOTGUN STEVE

Shh-sh-shh.

The car alarm keeps going off into the night.  SAW sees

something move, and turns, raising the machine gun, unloading

BRAKABRAKABRAKABRAKA into the side of three sedans; all of

their alarms go off, beginning the overture of a crazed,

dysphoric symphony.

Shotgun slaps SAW on the back of the head.

!SHOTGUN STEVE (CONT’D)

What the fuck , Jimmy?

SAW

He mighta been back there.  Maybe I

already got him.

The trio stands there waiting, and then there’s a thump, and

a car alarm starts going off behind them.  The three turn,

and SAW raises his gun, but Shotgun slaps it down.  They

stand there listening to the car alarms.

There’s a thump from the other side of circle, and another

alarm joins the chorus.  Then another, and another.

SHOTGUN STEVE

Ah man; all right, let’s get out of here.

There are two more thumps, and two more sirens start as the

men slowly begin to back out of the maze of cars.

CLOSE UP: A GRENADE BOUNCING AND ROLLING

!ALONG THE ASPHALT UNDER THE CARS.

BOOM! A car on the other side of the lot EXPLODES into

flames.  All three men turn, looking at the explosion, not

noticing that Mr. Right now stands between SAW and UZI.

Mr. Right leans over Saw’s shoulder, talking into his ear.

!CON TINUE D:

!(CO NTINU ED)

RIGHT

(gleeful whisper)

I’m gonna shoot you .

It is here for the first time that we see Mr. Right in a

combat situation.  When he moves, it is in strictly sweeps,

glides and snaps; it could be compared to the dancing of Gene

Kelly and Fred Astaire , in that everything looks effortless

and smooth.

The effect is visually beautiful, blindingly fast,  and

absolutely lethal .

Saw turns around, firing the massive machine gun at random,

whereupon Mr. Right grape-vines his arm and quickly shoots

him the in the side of the head, then gracefully turns, slaps

Uzi’s gun aside, kicks him in the nuts and then shoots him in

the forehead as he falls forward.

Right looks around, confused; where’s Shotgun Steve gone?

Right turns directly into Shotgun Steve FIRING THE SHOTGUN

OFF INTO HIS FACE FROM FOUR FEET AWAY , having ducked behind

the front of a car.

Right stumbles back, and blood pours from a dozen or so small

holes in his face and neck; he also has a bunch of holes in

his upper chest and shoulders, which spot red with blood.  He

looks stunned.

Shotgun Steve, equally stunned, tries to cock the shotgun;

Mr. Right raises his pistol, holding it on Shotgun Steve.

!RIGHT (CONT'D)

(pained)

Drop that.

Steve drops the shotgun.  Mr. Right slightly lowers his

pistol.

!RIGHT (CONT'D)

(genuinely baffled)

Birdshot? They gave you birdshot?

Shotgun Steve goes for his pistol, but Mr. Right immediately

brings his gun up into Steve’s face.

denying it, man, you got me.  Shotgun

Mr. Right laughs, and shakes his head.  Steve just stares at

him.

RIGHT

(sighs)

You should get out of here.

Steve nods fervently.

!RIGHT (CONT’D)

Shotgun Steve takes off running.  The friendliness seems to

drain from Mr. Right’s face, and he looks alarmingly

emotionally vacant, thinking.

FLASH TO MR. RIGHT’S VIEW OF

!THE PARK EARLIER THAT DAY.

Mr. Right sits on the bench with Charlie, and one by one, the

elements off the world crash away, finally leaving Charlie

and Mr. Right hanging in a void, and Martha sitting in

HOPPER

Minch has no friends.  He barely ever

talks to anyone.  He spends hours in his

apartment, sitting and not moving,

staring at nothing, goes to work, sells

cars, comes home.  Around you, his

behavior is...unique.  He expresses

himself; emotions other than that blank,

happy thing he’s got going on.  You’re

the one person in my entire time tracking

him that he’s had any kind of meaningful

interaction with that didn’t end in a

bullet...or a new car.

Martha smiles a tiny bit, and Hopper, though he doesn’t

smile, acknowledges it.

!HOPPER (CONT’D)

to his right, a grenade rolls out and bumps into the wall.

Hopper, knowing Right’s tricks too well, spins and draws his

gun, kneeling, aiming down the hall to his left.

He waits, bracing himself for the explosion of the grenade

behind him, focusing, keeping his aim straight.  Mr. Right

casually strolls up behind him, pocketing the grenade.

Right yanks down the back of Hopper’s collar and-

snatches away the knife C has drawn, slaps C and stabs B in

the gun out of F’s hand and shoots him in the eye.

Right smashes into Johnny Howl, knocking him into the wall,

but Howl shoves him off and brutally punches him straight in

the face, knocking off the clown nose.

Right staggers back, and Howl punches him again; he staggers

again, and Howl pulls out a big revolver, which Right

promptly bashes away with his own guns, knocking it onto the

twists around and slams his hands into the wall , causing him

to drop the guns.

face, breaking free of his grip.  He reaches into his coat

and tries to pull out the taser , but Howl hooks his elbow and

pulls him into a punch, knocking him down.

The punches have torn open all of the birdshot wounds, and

Mr. Right is covered in blood.  Howl smiles, turning and

picking up the clown nose.

He’s up there, man, he’s-

Johnny Howl comes crashing through a fifth floor window,

landing roughly on a fire escape terrace.

Von gasps; up on the terrace, Johnny Howl, starts to shakily

get up.

ZEKE

Now what the what the fuck do we

do?

PAN OVER TO THE ALLEY BETWEEN

!BUILDINGS, WHERE...

Mr. Right pops out of the emergency stairwell, Martha pulled

along behind him.  They go to the edge of the alley, and Mr.

Right peeks out at the men.

MARTHA

What next?

RIGHT

I don’t know, I’ve never shot this many

guys at once before.

MARTHA

Where’s your car?

Right nods at the ramp to an underground garage...Across the

street.

!MARTHA (CONT’D)

Well, that sucks.

RIGHT

Yeah.

Mr. Right draws a revolver out of his coat, handing it to

Martha.

!RIGHT (CONT’D)

Here, take this.  Just point and click.

MARTHA

I don’t want to shoot anyone-

RIGHT

You won’t have to if you don’t want to,

it would just, it would help a lot.  You

really should.

MARTHA

(laughs nervously)

Yeah?

RIGHT

Yeah.

Mr. Right glances at a dumpster at the edge of the alley.

Martha stares at him.

!RIGHT (CONT’D)

Do you trust me?

MARTHA

(quietly)

You never lied to me.

RIGHT

Do you trust me?

Martha smile, exhilarated.

!BACK TO THE STREET...

The dumpster comes rolling out of the alley to the middle of

the street, and Steve, Zeke , Von and all four goons open fire

on it.

Right, Martha behind him, strolls out of the alley, a gun in

each hand.  As he walks, he shoots two of the goons, one in

the shoulder and one in the head ; he continues firing

randomly until the thugs back off a little, then yanks Martha

and spins her around, waltz-dipping her behind the dumpster

and kissing her on the mouth as dozens of bullets ricochet

and spark off the steel.

SHOTGUN STEVE

Stop shooting, damnit , wait until we have

a clear shot!

ZEKE

Fuck that, kill’em , kill’em!

Back behind the dumpster, Right and Martha are sitting side

by side as Right checks the ammunition on his “borrowed”

guns.  He pushes back his coat to reveal that he has two

pistol holsters on his hips, each with a small red button.

RIGHT

(singing under his breath)

How’dya do, mighty pleasant greetin’ ,

fine how are you, good to be repeatin’ ,

MARTHA

Is that...Splash Mountain?

RIGHT

Yeah, it’s a good ride.

!CON TINUE D:

!(CO NTINU ED)

Right presses the red buttons on his dual holsters, and the

guns, apparently springloaded , launch straight up into the

air. All the guys, excluding Shotgun Steve, follow the guns

with their eyes.  Steve grabs Von and ducks down, as Mr.

Right pops up onto his feet.

In less than two seconds, Mr. Right has casually shot and

killed four of the seven men, all, all direct hits to the

head; he tosses away the “borrowed” guns and catches his own

guns as they fall back down, doing a balletic twirl and then

continuing to shoot, catching the last three unnamed men,

including the already injured goons, each with perfect center

of the forehead shots.

Zeke pops up, holding an AK-47 , and starts firing at random

at Mr. Right, who grabs Martha and begins a mad dash towards

the ramp down into the garage.

Johnny Howl, clearly furious, bursts out of front door of

Martha’s apartment building, pulling a sawed off Shotgun out

of his thigh holster, and repeatedly firing as he walks

further out into the street.

Mr. Right and Martha disappear down the ramp, and Johnny Howl

stops, turning and going to his car.

VON

Johnny what do we-

JOHNNY HOWL

I got it.

VON

Remember Johnny, we can’t-

JOHNNY HOWL

I got it.

Johnny starts his car and slams on the gas, motoring down the

ramp. Zeke starts to slowly advance with his AK-47. Von

looks absolutely helpless, gun raised impotently.

SHOTGUN STEVE

(quietly)

Fuck this shit.

Steve goes to the truck of one of the cars, and takes out a

roll of flashbang grenades.  We pan to reveal Wally, slumped

super low in his seat, frantically talking into an FBI phone.

INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

Johnny Howl drives slowly through the parking structure, eyes

wide, searching; he has a certain animal countenance to him,

his pupils bouncing around like an angry wolf on the prowl.

His car passes Mr. Right and Martha, who hide behind a

concrete pillar.

Mr. Right hands Martha his keys, and silently points at the

car, then makes a “go-around” motion with his hand.  She

takes a moment to understand, then nods, and Right dives out

from behind the pillar while Martha runs off towards Mr.

Right’s car.

Mr. Right runs up the back of Howl’s car, firing repeatedly

into the roof, and Howl slams on the gas and dives out the

driver’s side.

The sudden acceleration drops Mr. Right painfully onto the

ground, but he manages to hold onto his guns, firing dazedly

at Johnny, who ducks behind a car.  Johnny’s car gently

crashes into the wall, and Johnny pops out like a jack-in-the-

box, advancing on Right and firing the shotgun as Right

scrambles out of the way.

Right flings one of his empty guns, and it clips Howl on the

side of the head, causing him to stumble back and be HIT BY

!MARTHA DRIVING RIGHT’S CAR!

Howl rolls off the hood; the impact wasn’t too bad, but it

was certainly enough to throw him into shock.

MARTHA

(rolls down the window)

!LOOK BOTH WAYS!

Right laughs.

!MARTHA (CONT'D)

!BITCH , YOU HAVE TO LOOK BOTH WAYS!

Right looks deliriously happy as he scrambles into the car.

She slams on the gas.

Right and Martha start to come up the ramp, when something

comes rolling down towards them.

RIGHT

(eyes wide)

Martha cover your-

There’s a blinding flash of light and sound as the flash-bang

grenade explodes, and they go crashing into a parking meter

on the other side of the street, sending coins everywhere.

There’s a moment of silence, and then Mr. Right drops out of

the car, pained and dazed, rubbing his eyes; Martha’s been

nearly knocked out by the impact from the airbag.

!RIGHT (CONT’D)

Martha... Martha ...

A flashbang rolls up next to him.

!RIGHT (CONT'D)

Aw , dang.

The flashbang EXPLODES in a flash of light and sound, and Mr.

Right stumbles back, crawling desperately.

Shotgun Steve comes out of NOWHERE, smashing Mr. Right with a

baseball bat, knocking him down .  Right, in extreme pain,

turns and swats the bat out of Steve’s hands, grabs him by

the arm and slams him against the car.

Zeke bull-tackles the dazed Right, but Right shrugs him off,

slamming his body into the side of the car; as Zeke raises

his gun, Right snatches it away from him, headbutts him in

the face, and turns to try to shoot Steve, but Steve bashes

his hand with the baseball bat, bashes him in the arm, and

then raises the bat in the air to smash Right’s skull as

Right flips out a switchblade when-

!BANG!

VON

!ENOUGH .

Von stands, holding the dazed Martha to him tightly with one

hand, his smoking pistol raised in the other.

RIGHT

Steve?

Steve stands very still, confused.

!RIGHT (CONT’D)

Steve, is that you?  Did you get me

again?  And then he stopped you, or...

(to Von)

Jesus christ , man, what’re you doing to

this poor guy?

Right kicks Steve, in the chest, leaps to his feet, rolls

across the trunk, and takes cover behind the car.  Steve and

Zeke grab up their guns and fire repeatedly into the car,

while Von backs up, dragging Martha with him.

Mr. Right smiles, and Von jostles Martha and she gasps.

Right’s smile vanishes, and he tosses away the switchblade.

Johnny Howl comes limping up from the underground garage, as

Zeke and Steve frantically reload.

JOHNNY HOWL

(tilting his ear)

STEVE

I don’t hear anything-

VON

Zeke runs off to start the car.

Why are we taking the girl?  We’ve got

VON

Just do it, Steve.

Johnny nods at the car, and Von and Johnny start backing up.

Right calls out to them.

RIGHT

You’re a bad guy, aren’t you?

Von stops, shouting back at the car.

Von viciously slaps Martha.  Right winces behind the car.

Police sirens are approaching.  Johnny grabs up one of the

flashbangs and bowls it towards the car right hides behind.

RIGHT

I’m going to get you.

VON

Yeah, give it your best shot,

Right pops up from behind the car, motioning as though he’s

going to throw the switchblade, and then the flashbang comes

to rest at his feet.

!WHITE FLASH.

!SLAM TO BLACK.

EXT. THE CARTIGAN LODGE - NIGHT - LATER

It’s a massive house just outside of the city, in a wooded

area.  The three cars approach, and stop at a gate.  Von

leans out the window to shout back to Steve.

Yeah?

VON

Wait out here, okay?

SHOTGUN STEVE

What?  Why?

!CON TINUE D:

Shotgun Steve seems conflicted, but then sighs and pulls over

his car next to the gatehouse as the others drive in.

He lights a cigarette, and then shakes his head, frustrated,

thinking.

!CUT TO BLACK.

There’s faint, somewhat chaotic music.  It’s pretty; as

though composed from ambient sounds, woven together to form

one flowing song.  It gradually falls apart, separating into

individual sounds, which leads to...

FADE IN: MR. RIGHT DAZEDLY

!WAKING UP...

EXT. MARTHA’S APARTMENT BUILDING - LATER

Mr. Right blinks, he’s face down on the asphalt.  He sees his

clown nose sitting only a couple feet away, and reaches for

it;  we hear dozens of guns cock.

He looks around; there are eight police cars parked on the

road, some with lights on, and a mess of police officers,

Wally and Hopper stand behind the cars, pistols and shotguns

raised, trained on Mr. Right; he’s covered in laser sights.

Mr. Right puts on his clown nose.  Hopper blinks and flinches

a little.

COP SERGEANT

Hit him with the gas.

HOPPER

!NO WAIT -

Two tear gas canisters are fired out at Mr. Right from

grenade launchers; he spins, catching them in his coat and

then using it as a sling to fling the canisters BACK AT THE

POLICE CARS, IMMEDIATELY ROLLING RUNNING FORWARD INTO THE

!SMOKE.

All of the cops open fire at once, but he’s already too

close, and a majority of the shots seem to hit their own cars

as he speeds between them.  The laser sights dance crazily in

the fog of teargas, and we hear gunshots and sounds of

violence.

!CON TINUE D:

Wally and Hopper stumble away from the cars, frantically

trying to wave the tear gas away, when Mr. Right abruptly

rises in front of them.

He wears a bizarre, vaguelly insectoid gas-mask.  Wally goes

Hopper by the shoulder.

injured police officers being taken out of the dissipating

cloud of tear gas by paramedics.

Von stands in the corner, looking fidgety.  Bruce and Johnny

Howl are nearby as always, waiting, watching.

As they talk, Von looks through the window, making very

intense eye contact with Johnny Howl inside.  He does not

A long string of cars is headed towards the lodge.  The front

front of the house.

We pan over on the road to reveal Mr. Right and Agent Hopper,

sitting in the government car.  Mr. Right is staring at the

towards the closing gates.

Right walks casually past.

RIGHT

Hey Steve.

Right pulls his bizarre gas-mask down over his face, pops

three tear gas/smoke grenades, one yellow, one blue and one

purple, and hurls them towards the cars.

Right hits the group of men like a tornado as they start to

get out of the cars, dancing and skipping and having a lovely

A man tries to draw his gun, but Right snatches it away,

shoots two people, throws it back to the first guy, snatches

another gun and shoots him, shoots that gun’s owner, and then

slams his head in a door as he falls.

Right grabs a man in Waltz position, aims this way with his

“dance partner’s” gun, shoots three more men, then shoots his

dance partner and slides across and over the hood of a car.

He lands, pokes the driver of the car in the eye, ducks under

a wave of machine gun fire, shoots the machine gunner, and

drops two grenades into the driver’s lap.

Smoke has started to clog up, blurring everything into swirls

of color.

Right grabs a man in a half nelson, takes his gun, throws him

into two other guys, shoots all three, rolls, headbutts a man

in the stomach and catches his dropped gun out of midair.

Shoots a man behind him, shoots the headbutted man, and then

THE GRENADES GO OFF, knocking several men down . Right

doesn’t flinch .

He turns, shoots two more men, dance dodges a volley of

gunfire, and shoots the last four of the thugs as the smoke

completely envelopes the driveway.

It is a beautiful, beautiful thing.

He’s badly chewing his thumb nail.  Johnny appears in the

doorway.

Yeah, I see that.

Martha giggles through her gag.  Johnny pulls Von aside into

an alcove as Martha watches.

JOHNNY HOWL

Front yard is a fuckin’ warzone.

!CON TINUE D:

!(CO NTINU ED)

VON

We sit on the dog, and we get bit on the

ass.  I knew this would happen.

JOHNNY HOWL

Are you scared?

VON

I’m not scared, I’m just vibrantly aware

of the fact that we need to get the fuck

out of here, yesterday.

JOHNNY HOWL

Why don’t we just kill him?

VON

Kill who?

JOHNNY HOWL

Both of them.  Burn it all.

Von thinks for a moment.

VON

You think you can handle the clown?

JOHNNY HOWL

(shrugs)

I mean, it’ll be interesting, anyway.

VON

So I should...

JOHNNY HOWL

Yeah.

There are more gunshots from downstairs, and Von grimaces.

VON

I gotta get the gas. Fuck this house.

JOHNNY HOWL

You’ll have to go past him.

Zeke runs up to the door.

ZEKE

He’s inside.

Von stares at Johnny, who nods.

JOHNNY HOWL

Stay sharp.

!CON TINUE D:

!(CO NTINU ED)

VON

(grins)

Zeke , get Bruce.  We’re takin’ this guy

down.

Von exits the room, out into the HALLWAY, and we track with

him as he’s joined by several goons, then Zeke and Bruce join

with several men, all armed, and they start to head

downstairs.

Johnny looks over at Martha.  Martha winks at him.  For once,

he’s not smiling.

INT. CARTIGAN LODGE - DEN - CONTINUOUS

The men walk down into the huge den, complete with a fancy

wet bar.  It’s connected to the foyer, and they see that

yellow, blue and purple smoke has begun to flood in from the

foyer.

There’s the sound of nearby machine gun fire.

ZEKE

What is that?  Where is he, in the

garage?

BRUCE

We have to get Richard out of the house.

VON

Fuck that, we end this nonsense here and

now.

There’s an explosion at the front of the house, and everyone

is jolted.

!VON (CONT’D)

Fucking christ-

Two bouncing betties slide in across the marble, coming to

rest at the feet of the group.

BRUCE

!SHIT GET DOWN-

Everyone tries to duck, but several men are still caught in

the shrapnel as the bouncing betties LAUNCH UP AND EXPLODE,

shredding them to pieces.

Everyone slowly gets to their feet, aiming their guns into

the roiling, twisting smoke.

!CON TINUE D:

!(CO NTINU ED)

ZEKE

Where is he?  Where is he?

Von starts quietly backing up to the back of the group.

BRUCE

Shh.  Wait.

!CLOSE ON:

Mr. Right’s eye peering through the scope of a sniper rifle.

EXT. CARTIGAN LODGE - FRONT OF THE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Shotgun Steve, out of the car, his eyes on the house, is

going through the injured, frantically organizing people who

are still mobile.

SHOTGUN STEVE

Come on!  Come on!  We’ve got to get into

the house!

BACK TO: THE DEN

A large window to the right of everyone shatters, and

everyone turns and shoots into the woods outside.

Von quietly ducks away, exiting the room , and then Bruce,

annoyed by all the irrational shooting, turns and sees that

there’s a tiny bullet hole in the wall to everyone’s left,

just above a window.

Up on the balcony over the staircase, a quietly observing

Johnny Howl notices too.  He smiles, but says nothing.  Bruce

realizes what’s happened, but he’s much too late.

BRUCE

No, he’s-

Mr. Right comes crashing through the tiny window behind

everyone, smashing into Bruce and pistol whipping Zeke across

the face as he stands.

Everyone turns, but he’s already standing at the center of

the crowd. The coward turns and runs; upstairs, Johnny backs

into the shadows.

It all happens blindingly fast:

!CON TINUE D:

!(CO NTINU ED)

Right turns and grabs a thug with two pistols in chest

holsters, flips them upside-down and shoots them up into his

armpits, ducks allowing two thugs to shoot each other, yanks

the pistols out of the chest holsters, kicks the body into

the two men behind him, shoots them both, ducks under a

shotgun blast, kicks the shotgun wielder in the knee, then

grabs his shotgun and yanks it away,

CUT TO: MARTHA SITTING IN

!THE CHAIR.

Martha listens to the chaos downstairs in the empty room,

giggling gleefully through the gag.

BACK TO: RIGHT KILLING

!EVERYONE.

Right launches one of his spring-loaded pistols into a man’s

face, catches it as it bounces off, trips a man behind him,

shoots him, shoots the guy whose face got bounced, blasts the

man behind him in the chest with the shotgun, and then holds

the shotgun out, butt first, to the gunless thug who

originally had the shotgun.

They stand there like that.  Mr. Right takes off his gas

mask, and grins.

RIGHT

Do you want your gun back?

GUNLESS THUG

...Yeah?

RIGHT

(laughs)

Psh , psych.

He flips the shotgun around and blasts the gunless thug in

the face.

Zeke abruptly stands behind Right, trying to raise his gun.

Right grabs him by the wrist, twirls him, takes the gun,

twirls him again, tears open his button up shirt, places the

barrel of the pistol sideways against his chest and FIRES .

The bullet fires off into the ceiling. Zeke screams as the

gun’s slide closes on his flesh ; Right shoves him down,

leaving the smoking gun hanging from Zeke’s chest as he

shrieks in pain.

Bruce rushes Mr. Right, but Right knocks him away, and raises

his gun at Bruce, who, presumably out of instinct, assumes a

karate pose.

!CON TINUE D:

!(CO NTINU ED)

They stand there like that amidst all the bodies.

!RIGHT (CONT'D)

(annoyed)

!HEY!

Bruce looks confused.

BRUCE

What?

RIGHT

This isn’t fair.  I don’t know karate.

BRUCE

You’ve got a fuckin’ gun , man!

RIGHT

Well...If I put down my gun, will you

promise not to use karate?

BRUCE

...Okay.

Right tosses away his gun, and Bruce immediately jump kicks

Right in the chest, knocking him over .

RIGHT

(pained, angry)

THAT WAS KARATE, YOU ARE TOTALLY USING

!KARATE-

Right tries to get up, but Bruce catches him with several

strikes to the body.  Right abruptly headbutts Bruce,

knocking him back, and then Bruce roundhouse kicks Right in

the face.

Right rolls, wiping the blood from his nose and drawing his

dual pistols, as Bruce turns and grabs a grenade, pulling out

the pin.  Bruce spins, ready to throw the grenade, only to

find that Right has both guns pointed directly at him, point

blank.

Bruce freezes.  Right smiles, and then notices the grenade in

his hand.  Bruce notices it too.  They stand there frozen.

!RIGHT (CONT'D)

!GET RID OF THE GRENADE!

Bruce, startled into action, quickly tosses the grenade away,

and it explodes behind the bar, shattering all the bottles

and blowing the counter apart.

Bruce stands staring at the destruction; Right looks

!CON TINUE D:

!(CO NTINU ED)

concerned.

!RIGHT (CONT'D)

Wow.

BRUCE

(in shock)

ohgahd .

RIGHT

You almost blew yourself up!

Bruce nods numbly, and starts to fall forward, but Right

catches him.

!RIGHT (CONT’D)

Here, sit down.

They sit down together.

!RIGHT (CONT’D)

Just take long, deep breaths, in through

the mouth, out through the nose.

Bruce nods and tries to regain control over his breathing.

!RIGHT (CONT’D)

Man, that was really scary .  What’s your

name?

BRUCE

B ...Bruce.

RIGHT

Damn, Bruce, I thought you were a goner.

BRUCE

(weakly)

I thought...You were gonna shoot me...

RIGHT

I was going to shoot you, but then you

pulled out that grenade and I was like,

look at the size of the balls on this gu-

The doors of the room burst open, and eight men wielding

different varieties of assault rifles burst in; Steve’s

reenforcements.

Time seems to freeze.

!CON TINUE D:

!(CO NTINU ED)

We see through Mr. Right’s POV as what looks like permanent

marker draws a “game-plan” on the men, numbering them and

crossing them off, drawing curved lines to represent when and

how they will raise their guns.  It quickly draws a smiley

face, and then-

Time unfreezes.

Before they can even fire a shot Right stands and fires

seemingly without aiming, bang bang bang bang bang bang bang,

going through the men like a shooting gallery, leaving only

one man standing as Right runs out of ammunition; he was

ducked down when they came in, and ran behind his

compatriots.

It’s Shotgun Steve; he rolls and raises his rifle, the laser

sight resting on Right’s forehead.

!RIGHT (CONT'D)

(Steve! smiles)

I thought that was you!

Steve stares at him; Right looks up at the laser sight on his

face.

!RIGHT (CONT’D)

Oh hey, you got me again!

Right gracefully lurches left, and Steve fires, but Right has

already lightning quick drawn a Deringer and fires a shot

that plinks off Steve’s rifle, knocking it out of his hands .

Right straightens up as though nothing happened.

!RIGHT (CONT’D)

(You shouldn’t have hesitated. thinks)

Steve, man, get over here.

Steve doesn’t move, frozen to the spot.

!RIGHT (CONT’D)

(less friendly)

Get over here.

Steve quickly gets up and goes over to Bruce and Right,

whereupon Right starts smiling again.

!RIGHT (CONT’D)

Bruce, do you know Steve?

Bruce nods.  Right sits Steve down next to Bruce.

!CON TINUE D:

!(CO NTINU ED)

!RIGHT (CONT’D)

(to Steve, quietly)

Bruce has just had a really rough

experience, so I’d appreciate it if you

could sit and keep him company till I get

back. Um , if I get back.

STEVE

Uh...yeah.

RIGHT

Radical, thanks dude.

Right smiles, and then races off through the doors and out of

sight.

Steve and Bruce sit in silence, and then Steve turns and

looks at the bodies of the other goons.  He let’s out a

muffled nervous chuckle, and then Bruce starts laughing.

They sit there laughing together.

INT. THE CARTIGAN LODGE - DRAWING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Martha, sitting alone, hears movement outside.  She continues

pushing the tape with her tongue as Richard enters from a

side door, holding a revolver and a duffle bag.

RICHARD

Stupid motherfuckers trying to-

The door bursts open, revealing Mr. Right.

Richard stares at Right; Right stares at Richard.

Martha finally spits off her tape gag.

MARTHA

IT’S A SET-UP, THEY ONLY KIDNAPPED

!ME TO GET YOU TO KILL HIM!

Right stops, frozen, listening.

RICHARD

(horrified)

What?

MARTHA

It’s Johnny Howl and your brother,

they, they used me as bait to-

JOHNNY HOWL

That’s enough of that.

!CON TINUE D:

!(CO NTINU ED)

Everyone turns to see Johnny Howl holding an MP5 , but he’s

too close to Right to get a shot off.  Right smashes the MP5

away and Howl ends up blasting the entire room with gunfire.

Richard rushes out, and Right turns, spinning Johnny Howl,

and throws him violently over the banister out in the

hallway, and down the stairs.

Right hurries back in, rushes to Martha and kisses her.

Though clearly in pain and physically and emotionally

exhausted, Martha laughs.

RIGHT

(aghast)

Jesus, what’d they do to you?

MARTHA

Just hit me a couple times-

Right looks crazy intense.

!MARTHA (CONT’D)

What, you’re going to kill them more than

you were already going to?  Come on.

RIGHT

(sighs, laughs)

Yeah that’s silly.

MARTHA

I’d really like to leave.

RIGHT

No, yeah, definitely.

Right stares at her; he’s overwhelmed to be back with her

again.

MARTHA

You just like me tied up.

Right shrugs, smiling, and then starts cutting her free.

INT. THE CARTIGAN LODGE - RICHARD’S OFFICE

Richard comes in, only to find Von pouring gasoline out of a

can onto everything in the office.

RICHARD

Clevon , what’re you-

Von Cartigan tosses the can at Richard Cartigan , knocking him

back a little, then draws out his pistol and shoots Richard

three times in the chest.

!CON TINUE D:

!(CO NTINU ED)

There’s a silence, and Richard slumps back against the wall,

staring at him.

(You fucking idiot. beat)

You are a FUCKING IDIOT, you know that

Richie? Smart Richie Cartigan protecting

his brother, smart Richie Cartigan gonna

be head of the family, smart Richie

Cartigan always in control, and I fucked

Richard stares at Von.

!VON (CONT’D)

See, you’re too smart.  I thought I was

smarter than you, that was my mistake.  I

was there when he killed the Piccolos,

and I thought, here, I can use this, I

can USE this.

RICHARD

I don’t...I don’t...

VON

Don’t you get it yet?  Bobby Yatsuda

didn’t kill Minkin , me and Johnny did!

Yatsuda probably doesn’t even know it

happened, it was all a part of the plan

to bring in the Grim Reaper out there, to

bring him gift wrapped to you.  But no,

you’re too fucking smart; even when we

readjust, we use the girl, we try to

bring him here, you corner us, trap us in

the fucking house with him, and now look

what you made me do!  Look what you made

me do!

RICHARD

You...are so... fucking ...stupid.

VON

Yeah, I get that a lot.

Von shoots Richie in the head.

INT. CARTIGAN LODGE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Right slowly leads Martha as they creep down the hallway and

down the stairs, talking as they go.

MARTHA

Why are we going so slow?

!CON TINUE D:

!(CO NTINU ED)

RIGHT

Less guys, now.  In all the chaos it’s

easy to just pass through people, because

no one’s sure what they’re aiming at. But

once you’re a target, alone, you’ve got

to be careful; if someone pops out it can

really screw you up.  That big guy scares

the crap out of me.

MARTHA

Johnny Howl.

RIGHT

What?

MARTHA

His name is Johnny Howl.

RIGHT

That’s a stupid name.

MARTHA

I know, right?

RIGHT

And he made fun of my nose.

MARTHA

I think the nose looks good.

RIGHT

Really?

They reach the bottom of the steps.

MARTHA

Yeah, I like it because it kind of makes

it feel like everyone’s having a good

time.

RIGHT

Well, ideally they are, it’s just-

WHAM! Right is hit FULL IN THE FACE WITH A BASEBALL BAT, and

he crashes to the floor. Johnny tries to hit Right again,

but Martha stomps on his foot, snatches away the bat and

bunts him in the neck.

Johnny sputters, coughing, and then Von cinches Martha in a

headlock from behind, choking her and holding a gun to her

head.

!CON TINUE D:

Von and Johnny realize that Right is gone, a trail of blood

leading off into the darkened library.

!VON (CONT’D)

Johnny, I’ll get a car, you-

JOHNNY HOWL

(half-calm, half-furious)

I’ve got it.

Von drags Martha off, and we walk with Johnny as he goes to

the door...

INT. CARTIGAN LODGE - LIBRARY

The room is dark, lit only by the deep blue early morning

light coming in from the big floor to ceiling windows.  The

room is cluttered with furniture; the place is being used for

storage, with almost no books on the shelves.  Mr. Right

could be anywhere.

Johnny Howl pops some gum into his mouth, and walks slowly

through the room, MP5 against his hip.  It’s near to

completely silent;

the only sound is his gum smacking as he chews.  He slowly

surveys the room, and his laser sight comes to rest on a

mirror.  He bounces the aimer back onto his forehead, looking

at his bloody reflection.

JOHNNY HOWL

Ooh , you’re a bad man Johnny Howl.

Johnny fires a single shot into his reflection, shattering

the mirror.  There’s a silence, but Johnny detects a tiny bit

of sound.

!JOHNNY HOWL (CONT’D)

(smiles, surveying the room)

Alone at last.

INT. CARTIGAN LODGE - GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

Von drags in Martha, and stares at the cars; Rolls Royces ,

Ferraris , Bentleys , all machine gunned to pieces.  Mr.

Martha laughs, and Von slaps her in the face.

JOHNNY HOWL

(loudly)

How’s your head?

!RIGHT (O.S.)

(from somewhere in the room)

I don’t know, how’s your neck?

Johnny chews for a moment and then smiles.

JOHNNY HOWL

Well, better now.

Johnny turns and starts unloading into a big oaken table,

which abruptly flips up and knocks him off balance .  Right

dives out as Johnny continues to fire at him.

EXT. CARTIGAN LODGE - SLOPE - CONTINUOUS

It’s a slope into the woods behind the house.

There’s silence, and then Johnny and Right come crashing

through the big windows at the side of the game room.

They plummet ten feet down to the ground, thud , with Right

having the worse landing.  They lay there motionless several

feet apart, surrounded by broken glass.

Johnny Howl slooooowly stands up as Mr. Right forces himself

to his knees.  Howl grabs Right by the back of the head and

knees him in the face, breaking his nose.

RIGHT

Agh!

JOHNNY HOWL

Bingo, baby!

Johnny Howl, clearly in pain but masking it well, yodels out

into the woods and listens to the echo.

!JOHNNY HOWL (CONT’D)

That’s bodacious, brother, let me tellya.

!CON TINUE D:

Howl turns and brutally decks Mr. Right in the already broken

nose, flooring him again. Howl takes a few steps back, gets

a running start and PUNTS RIGHT IN HIS INJURED LEG .

RIGHT

Aaaaaaghhhhhh you... you butthole!

Mr. Right snatches up a particularly nasty shard of glass;

Howl swings to punch him, and Right grabs him by the wrist

and slashes the tendons on the inside of his right elbow.

Howl yowls in pain, and Right ballet-twirls around him and

slashes the tendons behind his knees .  As he falls, Howl

turns and punches Right in face, knocking out one of his

teeth.

Mr. Right falls, laying still, and Johnny Howl breathes

heavily and swears, unable to get up.  Mr. Right rolls over

and smiles at him.

JOHNNY HOWL

(furious, in agony)

Fucking ...faggot...I’m gonna fucking kill

you... Fucking rip your face off and watch

you bleed...shoot that stupid whore of

yours and-

RIGHT

Well, that’s enough of you, I think.

Right slowly stands up, looks up at the climb back to the

window, then back down at Johnny Howl, who continues swearing

and

JOHNNY HOWL

I swear to god, you are dead, you a

dead man-

RIGHT

Shush.

Right swings a kick in towards Johnny Howl’s head, and we-

FLASH TO:

Von, dragging Martha along, out front of the house.

Over in the FBI car, Hopper sees what’s happening, and

frantically reaches down to his ankle, where a small revolver

is holstered. He can’t quite reach.

VON

Hurry the FUCK UP.

!CON TINUE D:

Von wrenches her arm again.  Martha shrieks, and yanks her

arm away; Von turns, raising his pistol.

!VON (CONT’D)

Von shoves the gun in her face and yanks her arm again,

causing her to cry out in pain. In the car, Hopper continues

to frantically reach for his pistol.

VON

Oh I’m sorry did that hurt?

In the FBI car, Hopper finally manages to draw his gun when-

MARTHA

(crying, eyes wide, horrified,

looking down the driveway)

What the fuck is that!?

Von turns to look, and Martha abruptly snatches his gun away

in the style of Mr. Right. Horrified, Von throws up his

hands and she shoots him through the left hand, the bullet

then hitting him in the shoulder.

VON

(stumbling back)

Agh , fuck!

MARTHA

(psychotic)

Oh I’m sorry does that hurt?

Martha raises the gun and shoots him point blank three times

in the chest. Von staggers and collapses against his car,

sliding down onto his side.  He lays there, pained,

struggling to breathe.  Martha starts to walk away, then

stops and turns around.

!MARTHA (CONT’D)

(furious)

I told you this would happen, didn’t I? I

told you but you didn’t take me

starts crying.

Right is gradually pulling himself back up into the window

into the now empty, corpse-covered room.  He makes it, and

then lays there on the floor, panting.

He hears a gun cock.

Zeke stands over Mr. Right, smiling down at him, gun drawn.

He keeps one hand over bloody burn/clip wound on his chest.

He presses the gun against Mr. Right’s head, and Mr. Right

cringes.

to bite you in the ass.

CUT TO: MARTHA RUNNING DOWN

There’s a gunshot, and then another, and Martha lets out a

little scream as she rushes back towards the house, holding

Von’s gun.  She gets to the front door; it’s locked, and she

screams again.

BACK TO: THE MAIN ROOM

!CON TINUE D:

!(CO NTINU ED)

Zeke stands over Mr. Right, his gun smoking.  We pan to

reveal a smoking hole in the floor, under his gun, next to

Right’s face.

There’s also a hole in Zeke’s back, which we notice as he

slowly turns around; he has a dazed look on his face as he

fires the gun off into the ground several more times.  We pan

to reveal Bruce and Shotgun Steve.

Shotgun Steve lowers his smoking pistol, Zeke collapses to

the floor, dead.  Steve looks to Bruce, who half nods.

BRUCE

Hey killer, you okay?

RIGHT

(groaning)

No...

Steve smiles.

EXT. CARTIGAN LODGE - MOMENTS LATER

Martha is banging on the door, crying uncontrollably, looking

psychotic.  The door unlocks, and she steps back, raising the

gun.

There’s a tense moment as the door slowly opens, revealing

Mr. Right, carried between Bruce and Shotgun Steve.  Martha

is holding the gun directly into Right’s face.

RIGHT

(dazed, wounded)

Oh...Hey Martha.

Martha takes a nervous look at Steve and Bruce, then

immediately one-armed embraces and kisses Right, smearing his

blood all over her.

Right laughs, and Martha snorts back tears.

seemingly endless stream of police cars pour by, sirens on.

A couple of SWAT officers tap on the window, and Hopper just

looks at them, and then sort of shrugs.

CUT TO: THE BACK

!OF THE HOUSE.

Several officers, guns drawn, approach Johnny Howl’s

motionless body.  He’s all covered in grey-white-black ash

change according to what Hopper discusses.

HOPPER

These two men, within the last month,

have settled into controlling positions

of what was formerly the Cartigan Crime

Syndicate.  Now, their rise to these

positions was of course facilitated by

the massacre at the Cartigan estate in

Bonville , where Francis Minch and Martha

McKay evaded capture after killing all

remaining members of the Cartigan family.

Now, as you know, the immediate capture

of Minch and McKay is the priority of

this task force, and over the next couple

of weeks we’re going to learn everything

(we can about them. beat)

As most of you know, I’ve been demoted to

Now pick up the jaw.

CUT TO: BRIEFING

ROOM

Hopper is cleaning up his presentation area, when a young

agent approaches him.

FBI AGENT

Hey, Agent Hopper-

HOPPER

Yes, Weitz , what’s up?

FBI AGENT

I was wondering if you’d be willing to

give me your own thoughts on the Francis

Minch situation.

HOPPER

Well-

FBI AGENT

Off the record.

HOPPER

(smiles)

Off the record.  Right.

!CON TINUE D:

!(MO RE)

!(CO NTINU ED)

Well, I think we’ve got it all backwards.

I don’t think he’s on the run.

!CUT TO: STREET IN PRAGUE -

DUSK

Right wanders down the road, much as we first saw him,

looking serenely happy.

!HOPPER (V.O.) (CONT'D)

I think he probably just took McKay, flew

somewhere he wanted to be and they’ve set

up shop like nothing’s wrong.  I think

he’s in love, and he’s done with

organized crime for now; he’s probably

selling cars, a travel agent, I don’t

know.

Right walks past an alley, where a group of Serbian thugs are

mercilessly beating on two men.  Right stops, casually eyeing

the men.

!SERBIAN THUG #1 (SUBTITLE)

(noticing Right)

The fuck are you looking at?  You want to

get it like these two faggots?  Keep

walking!

BACK TO: FBI BRIEFING ROOM

FBI AGENT

Would you say he’s still dangerous?

Hopper just stares at him, very serious.  His eyes say it

all.

BACK TO: THE ALLEY IN PRAGUE

The thugs are still beating on the man, when they notice that

Right still stands at the mouth of the alley.

!SERBIAN THUG #1 (SUBTITLE)

Hey, I thought I told you to...what the

fuck is that?

We go back to Mr. Right.

He’s put on the clown nose.

He smiles.

!SLAM TO BLACK.

!END.
