Space. Darkness. And then, a flash of fire, passing us, hooking us in its trail, pulling us along with it, a tiny meteorite plunging down into earth’s atmosphere...

>WE FOLLOW IT

Down burning through night sky, clouds, then out over the ocean, plunging into the water with a burst of steam.

After a moment, there’s another plop, another burst of steam.

And then, like raindrops, hundreds of tiny fragments begin striking the ocean, when suddenly-

A HUGE fireball, CRASHING INTO THE OCEAN- dragging us under-

Revealing a title, coming up slowly, from the murky depths...

>POWER RANGERS

SLAM TO:

A dead fish. Out on the beach. Dozens...no, hundreds; it’s a mass wash-up, disgusting, covering the beach of idyllic

ANGEL GROVE, California, as far as the eye can see. School buses are parked next to the beach; it’s a big volunteer clean-up, people everywhere.

We’re near a carnival pier, the centerpiece of which is a huge, colorful, old-fasioned ferris wheel. A sign reads “WELCOME TO ANGEL GROVE, HOME TO AMERICA’S 4TH 5TH LARGEST FERRIS WHEEL!”

The pier is clearly currently closed.

JASON Scott, 17, kneels next to a shark. Jason’s alpha male good-looks and natural athleticism are dampened by an immediate aloofness; he’s rough around the edges, anxious.

JASON
Look at the teeth on this guy.

William “BILLY” Cranston, 17, approaches behind him, putting fish into a plastic bag solemnly. Calling Billy a “nerd” would be a little unfair....But only a little.

BILLY
It’s climate change. It has to be. The water gets polluted, plastics dissolve and poison it, and then when stuff like this happens sure, we’ll clean up all the dead fish, but we don’t solve the real problem-

JASON
What?

Jason pulls out earbuds, which blast screaming guitars.

BILLY
...What?

JASON
Were you saying something?

BILLY
I’ve been talking to you for like twenty minutes-

JASON^
About the climate change?

BILLY
I thought you didn’t hear me?

JASON
You were talking about it on the bus, man-

BILLY
Yeah, but-

Jason starts heading further down the beach, talking as he heads off.

JASON
That’s like the basis of our friendship. I can tune out for a while and when I come back you’ll still be saying the same thing.
(Billy reacts)
Hey, to me, this is half day off school. I mean it sucks for the fish but it’s not our job to figure out why.

Billy plaintively shouts after him, already out of earshot.

BILLY
Maybe if you showed some interest once in a while, it might lead to you being a more balanced person-

SKULL (O.S.)
Cranston, think fast!

Billy, distracted turns to see SKULL, 16, a skinny, ratfaced creep, grinning at him from up the beach-

-but doesn’t see BULK, 17, a lumbering, douchey goober coming up behind him; Bulk slaps two dead fish on either side Billy’s head- Ew! Ow!

Billy, startled, falls into the dead fish.

BULK
Watch your step there, Cranston.

Bulk and Skull laugh as Billy, dazed, fumbles through dead fish for his glasses.

BILLY
Guys- just- leave me alone-

BULK
(impression of Billy)
“Leave me aloooone”

SKULL
Here, I found you a friend.

Skull picks up a dead crab, taking aim- WHAM!

.SKULL IS DROPPED WITH A ROUNDHOUSE KICK TO THE FACE!

Jason steps over Skull, whining and clutching his nose, moving towards Bulk, picking up the crab.

BULK
Hey, Jason- what the hell! Violence doesn’t solve anything!

JASON
(to Billy)
You okay?

Billy sits up, wiping off his glasses. He looks mad.

BILLY
I’m fine.

Bulk is helping Skull up.

SKULL
My dad’s a lawyer, idiot!

BULK
See who looks tough once your poor ass family gets sued into the ground!

Bulk throws a fish, which hits Jason in the shoulder. Jason turns sharply.

BULK
WAIT WAIT WAIT VIOLENCE DOESN’T SOLVE ANYTHING-

INT. SCOTT RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - LATER

Jason sits across from his pacing father.

MR. SCOTT, late 40s, still in his Angel Grove Police Department uniform, seems an even mix of frustrated and bewildered; this is a man who’s used to stress, and yet somehow his kid has again taken him to the limit.

MR. SCOTT
So, nothing. No comment.

Jason looks down, defiant but embarrassed. Teenager.

MR. SCOTT
How the hell do you get into a fight at beach clean-up-

JASON
They were picking on Billy-

MR. SCOTT
So just, zero self control. All leap no look, jesus-
(beat)
Karate was supposed to teach you discipline. You’re seventeen, you can’t just get in fights anymore.

JASON
People are dicks, it’s not my fault-

MR. SCOTT
You know what, I’m sick of hearing that. The problem isn’t them, it’s you. You don’t think, Jason.

Jason stares at the floor, unsure who to be angry at.

EXT. SCOTT RESIDENCE - LATER

The police car in the driveway pulls out, leaving. After a moment, an ugly minivan drives up; Jason pops out, running over to the van, where Billy sits behind the wheel.

Billy looks apprehensive, but Jason does a silly dance and Billy laughs.

JASON
Look at you in the mom-mobile!

BILLY
Look at you in the no-car-at-all!

Jason laughs; point, Billy.

>LATER

The two boys drive through Angel Grove as the sun sets; Angel Grove is a beautiful little beach-side city, kind of a cross between Santa Cruz and San Diego.

BILLY
Was it bad?

JASON
You know, the usual; my dad thinks I’m a criminal.

BILLY
Aw, c’mon man-

JASON
He like almost literally said it.

BILLY
(cautiously)
Well- I mean-

JASON^
What?

BILLY
Just....You know, you’re aggro.

JASON
Really, you too?

BILLY
See, you can’t take criticism-

JASON
Hey it’s not my fault you can’t stick up for yourself-

BILLY
-I didn’t ask you to kick anyone in the face.

JASON
C’mon, you loved it a little bit. Just a liiiittle bit-

After a moment, Billy acquiesces, Billy laughing self-consciously.

JASON
You’re lucky, you’re getting out of here, dude. Three hours from San Francisco, three hours from LA, we’re not even the middle of nowhere, we’re like, the middle of “where,” I mean is having the FIFTH largest ferris wheel even something to brag about-

BILLY
We’ve got Wiggy Woggle Arcade-

JASON
Wiggy Woggle Arcade was lame when we were NINE, Billy-

JASON
You like Wiggy Woggle Arcade, I know, I know

BILLY^
(quietly)
I like Wiggy Woggle Arcade

Billy sees something out the window and suddenly freaks out.

BILLY
Duck! Duck!

Billy accidentally slams Jason’s face into the glove compartment-

JASON
OW! HEY WHAT THE HELL-

BILLY^
Get down get down-

Jason ducks, as they drive past Jason’s dad, in a cop car.

Billy gives a super-weird fake smile and wave.

BILLY
Hiiiiiiii.

EXT. THE OCEAN FLOOR

Deep and blue, constant twilight at the bottom of Angel Bay.

Barely visible, the huge meteorite we saw land at the top of page 1 sits motionless. There’s suddenly a loud whirring and clanking from within; it cracks open, light blasting out!

SLAM TO:

EXT. THE ANGEL GROVE PACIFIC MUSEUM - CONTINUOUS

The parking lot lights flicker; some kind of power surge, as Billy’s van drives in.

JASON
The museum? I thought you said we were doing something fun?

BILLY
Hey, we can still go to Wiggy Woggle Arcade-

JASON
Okay, okay-

A car backfires as it passes them, startling them both; a black 1979 Trans-Am, beat all to hell, heading off into the parking lot, up towards the museum.

JASON
Holy crap, that’s Kim Hart’s car. Kim’s back in town?

Billy seems shocked to see the car, and is momentarily a little lost.

BILLY
I- I guess so-

JASON
Dude if Kim’s here that only means one thing: Free drinks.

.MOMENTS LATER

Jason and Billy are walking up to the museum, through a big crowd. People are drinking from plastic champagne flutes and eating ouer’derves. Music plays from inside.

A banner reads “OUR ANCIENT ANCESTORS - ONE NIGHT ONLY!”

JASON
Look at this crowd-

BILLY
Yeah, lotsa people down from San Francisco- The Pastel Canyon Dig artifacts are only being shown for one night before they take them to UCLA for study.

JASON
You have totally lost me-

BILLY
They told us in class- Man don’t you pay attention to anything?

JASON
I do my best not to.

BILLY
(groaning)
Get your school ID.

INT. THE ANGEL GROVE PACIFIC MUSEUM

It’s a gala event, people everywhere of all ages, but clearly a lot of bored high-school kids happy for the free food and cheap champagne.

The main hall of the museum is also housing the exhibit, which features many displays spread around the space.

JASON
This is crazy.

BILLY
It’s a big deal that we even got the display for a night. These pieces are carbon dated at over thirty thousand years old. It’s the biggest thing to happen in Angel Grove since- ever, basically.

JASON
What? Why? Did we find Fred Flintstone’s car?

BILLY
It challenges every kind of archaeological thinking. This stuff predates the bronze age by almost fifteen thousand years.

JASON
So?

BILLY
So that’s- a huge deal? A culture advanced enough to cast metal hundreds of centuries before anything else we’ve found is-

JASON
So what is it, like cave man stuff? What’s so...cool...
(beat)
Whoa.

Jason is transfixed by one of the displays; it’s a massive set of GOLDEN ARMOR, brutalist and jagged, standing at almost nine feet tall.

BILLY
See? I knew you’d find something to appreciate.

JASON
It’s like...That’s a big dude.

>ELSWHERE IN THE

>HALL

ZACK Taylor, 18, handsome in that varsity jacket way, with a poppy, confident, free-wheeling energy, girls checking him out, dudes waving to him, heads through the crowd.

He approaches a group of athletic guys seated at a table.

ZACK
Hey guys, I-

One of them pushes in the only free seat.

JERK FOOTBALL PLAYER
Sorry Taylor, somebody’s sitting there.

ZACK
...Nobody’s sitting there.

JERK FOOTBALL PLAYER #2
Maybe try catching the ball next time.

ZACK
Really? Whatever.

Zack walks away.

>MOMENTS LATER.

Zack’s off to the side of the exhibit, trying to make sulking look broody and cool.

Zack’s girlfriend, ANGELA Griggs, 16, popular girl, gorgeous and wise beyond her years, approaches.

ANGELA
Why do you take that crap from them?

ZACK
They’re just messing around, Angela-

ANGELA
I don’t know how being jerks is supposed to help you-

ZACK
It’s just...Guy stuff.

ANGELA
Your team is supposed to back you up, not knock you down.

ZACK
You’re all the back up I need.

Angela smiles, and then notices Jason over at catering snarfing up taquitos.

ANGELA
Why is Jason Scott at a school event?

.MOMENTS LATER

Jason’s eating taquitos and looking with interest at the display of a huge golden sword, clearly a companion piece to the armor.

He turns, noticing some kind of mummified head- or, is it?

On closer inspection, it looks to be some kind of ancient sculpture...No, not a human head at all, gray, with eerie, hollow eye sockets and puckered, wrinkly skin-

ZACK
Hey Jason-

JASON
(startled)
AH!

ZACK^
Oh sorry- I didn’t mean to-

JASON
(failing to play it cool)
No man I’m fine, totally fine.

ZACK
Been a while, right?

JASON
...Uh, yeah. Like three years.

ZACK
Yeah, I’ve been- y’know-

JASON
Busy, right.

ZACK
(self-conscious)
Yeah.
(beat)
How’s Bill?

JASON
He’s fine. He’s going to Princeton.

ZACK
Oh- no way, where are you going? Do you know yet-

JASON
I’m just gonna- I’m gonna find Billy, we were getting ready to go-

ZACK
Oh, right, well- I’ll see you around-

JASON
Right, yeah, “see you around-”

Jason just looks at him, chuckles, and walks off. Zack sighs; friendship fail.

>ELSEWHERE...

Billy is holding a pamphlet, reading from it as he looks up at the centerpiece of the exhibit; it’s a massive...staff?

Scepter?

Standing upright, the complex and ornate detailing on the scepter, which ends in a huge half-moon crescent adorned with a giant red ruby, is startlingly beautiful.

The lights flicker again; people look around, confused...But Billy notices a weird glint on the ruby.

BILLY
Whaaaat?

KIM
It’s beautiful, isn’t it?

Billy turns to see

KIM Hart, 17, leaning on the rail next to him.

The washed out pink streaks in her hair and heavy eyeliner start the picture that’s completed by her wardrobe; torn up black jeans, torn up muscle-T, patched up moto-jacket...

Don’t let her good looks fool you. This is one of the raspy voiced, glowering day-ditcher kids your mom warned you about.

BILLY
Haven’t seen you since you dropped out. ...Why are you here?

KIM
(insulted)
“why am I here?”

BILLY
I just- I mean- this isn’t really your “scene.”

KIM
How do you know, maybe I got fancy.

BILLY
I thought you were still on tour with that Ricky guy-

KIM
No, that’s over. Ricky’s great, he’s just- ha- a little immature-

BILLY
I’d imagine a 35 year old dating an 18 year old might have that problem, yeah.

Kim is stung, but hides it. In fact, that bad kid I was talking about earlier seems a little shaky around dorky ol’ Billy Cranston.

KIM
I heard about what happened on the beach, Bulk and Skull tried to make it sound like Jason hit’em for no reason but I know he musta been-

BILLY
Thanks Kim. Really nice to see you again.

Kim’s flustered; clearly uncharacteristic for her.

KIM
Hey, Bill, I’m sorry man I didn’t mean to- it’s just, I know it’s been a while since we talked, and I’d really like to hang out with someone like you for once-

BILLY
“someone like me”

KIM
-Someone smart, you know, or- you, not someone like you, YOU, before you go off to college-

BILLY
Right. Like I said: great to see you, Kim.

Billy walks off, Kim hides her vulnerability, shaking it off with a sigh, and looks up at the half-moon scepter.

SLAM TO:

The Scepter’s shape, now represented on a high tech control panel, FLASHING ALARMS AND SIRENS.

@INT. ZORDON’S SATELLITE
(Pardon the wealth of description here, but we’re not in Angel Grove anymore)

The claustrophobic interior of a tiny spaceship in high orbit around planet Earth; ancient looking hyper-advanced technology; it’s dark, lit by the flashing alarms, hectic.

A cryogenic sleep tube, roughly the size of a minifridge, bursts open in a gush of electric blue-steam and crackling electricity.

From this, gasping and bleary from two dozen millenia of cryogenic sleep, emerges

ZORDON, 40,000, fascinating to behold. He’s not human; he’s nothing CLOSE to human; the passive glance would lead a person to comparisons with E.T, mixed with some distant undersea squid; two feet tall, with tentacles and a broad, expressive and utterly alien face.

But in his eyes, we immediately read intelligence, wisdom, humanity, after a fashion. And emotion: panic.

He moves to a wall of holographic displays, scrolling in alien hieroglyphic at a million miles a minute.

Zordon’s eyes widen in horror; the swell of ominous music on the score tells us what we need to know about those screens.

He turns, his tentacles quickly propelling him to a console; he activates it, and five small devices are presented to him.

Zordon turns, climbs onto the golden disk, and then inside of it, slamming a hatch closed, moments before the ship OPENS-

Yanking the disk out into the vacuum of space, into an IMMENSE freefall, down, down, down towards EARTH-

TRINI (V.O.)
It’s because she has a crush on you-

BILLY (V.O.)
Oh c’mon-

EXT. THE KWAN HOUSE - BACK PORCH - CONTINUOUS

TRINI Kwan, 18, lean and no nonsense, stands out on the porch of her parent’s beautiful Nor-Cal ranch house. Trini’s got an intellectual edge, but in a different way than Billy:

A nerd? Never. A buzzkill? Definitely. This is a person who’d be a lot more fun if they had about 100 less “rules.”

Billy and Jason are behind her, on lawn chairs around a fire, roasting marshmallows. The stars above them illuminate rolling hills and orchards; this is the country outside Angel Grove that people take wine tours in.

JASON
She definitely does. She never got over the break-up, you player-

BILLY
That was junior high- and she broke up with ME, to date Tommy Oliver-

TRINI
Look all I’m saying is this is the end of senior year; Kim’s probably just desperate to find a guy who isn’t a complete washout.

JASON
OR maybe she just really likes him; I never understood what you guys have against her.

TRINI
Oh my god, she’s a total juvenile delinquent tryhard basket-case lowest common denominator-

BILLY^
Because she’s a completely pathetic hyper-aggressive problem child wannabe drop-out-

JASON
Hey, whoa, easy, okay okay okay-

INT. THE KWAN HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Jason and Trini are in the tastefully appointed kitchen, getting pizza rolls out of the oven.

TRINI
He didn’t say anything else?

JASON
Nah, I shut him down.

TRINI
You and Zack used to be like best friends, you should’ve at least given him a chance-

JASON
What, to flake on me again? I mean you can say what you want about Billy, but at least he doesn’t think he’s too cool to hang out.

Jason goes outside, passing Billy as he comes in.

BILLY
Trouble in paradise?

TRINI
You know we’re broken up.

BILLY
Yeah, wow, three whole days-

TRINI^
It’s real this time.

BILLY
Realer than the last hundred times?

TRINI
It’s the mature thing to do- I’m moving away at the end of summer, it’ll be less dramatic this way-

BILLY
Yeah, this is totally not dramatic-

TRINI
That’s just Jason.

BILLY
(musing to himself)
Yeah. Dealt with that a lot today-

TRINI
What do you mean?

BILLY
(backtracking)
Nothing, nothing-

TRINI
What happened today?

BILLY
Just this thing at the beach-

Trini, intense, steps towards Billy, who cowers, menaced with a pizza-roll.

TRINI
What happened at the beach today?

>OUTSIDE

Jason sighs, grumpy, looking out at the night sky. He perks up, noticing something; a tiny orange dot, one of the stars, getting steadily bigger...

JASON
...No way...

Trini bursts out of the house, an apologetic Billy in tow.

TRINI
YOU GOT IN ANOTHER FIGHT?

JASON
(dazed)
Huh?
(angry)
Billy COME ON man-

TRINI
Don’t make this about him, why wouldn’t you tell me?

JASON
Why would I, like I need to get lectured twice in one day-

TRINI
Oh so now I’m “lecturing you?” It’s stuff like this that let’s me know you’re still too immature for a real relationship-

JASON
For once I wish you’d just yell at me instead of talking to me like I’m a nine year old-

BILLY
Hereee we go-

TRINI
Oh this is about me now? How do you expect anyone to treat you like an adult if you keep acting like a-

AN ORANGE FIREBALL GOES BLAZING DIRECTLY

OVER THE HOUSE, ALL THREE TEENS DROP IN SHOCK AS IT STREAKS DOWN OVER THE NEIGHBORING VINEYARD, SMASHING THROUGH AN OLD ABANDONED BARN BEFORE SLAMMING INTO THE GROUND, BAM.

The power in Trini’s house flickers on and off, ominously, as Jason gets to his feet. The night is eerily silent; he rushes to Trini, who’s in shock.

JASON
You okay?

TRINI
What- what- what was-

Billy’s putting his glasses back on, looking out at the fading orange glow.

BILLY
Some- some kid of meteor or-

Jason stands up, staring out at the field, cogs in his head turning. His eyes light up with a new, impulsive and maybe dangerous priority.

JASON
Let’s go check it out.

BILLY
What? Jason, no, wait-

JASON
What?

BILLY
We have no idea what it is; it could be radioactive, or-dangerous, there could be a million different things that-

JASON
IT JUST FELL FROM OUTER-SPACE, you’re telling me you don’t wanna at least take a look-

TRINI
Th- that’s n- not our property, that’s the old Wasserman vineyard, it’d be trespassing- we should call the police-

JASON
You two are seriously gonna let the coolest thing that’s ever happened to any of us get handled by Angel Grove PD, no way, I’m going-

BILLY
Hey man just wait a second-

TRINI^
Jason I swear if you don’t-

JASON
Whatever, I’ll send you a selfie.

Jason hops over the edge of the porch, headed for the Old Wasserman vineyard. Billy and Trini exchange a look.

BILLY
Well. This is bad.

EXT. WASSERMAN VINEYARD - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Jason pushes his way under an old, rusted out fence, into the long dead fields of the abandoned Wasserman Vineyard.

IT IS EXTREMELY CREEPY. Jason cautiously heads forward, clearly having some second thoughts as he glances back at the fading light from Trini’s house.

JASON
(shaking it off)
Nerds.

Something PASSES HIM IN THE ORCHARD! Jason yelps, fumbling out his smartphone, light on. There’s nothing.

JASON
(whistles air, nervous)
....Nerds.

Jason heads off; he doesn’t see what we do; a ring of red lights, close to the ground; we follow it, out into the road-

It’s that Golden Disk we saw Zordon use, a mini-flying saucer, but the way it walks on thin, spider legs makes it clear that it has an intelligence of its own.

This is ALPHA 5.

It wanders out into the road, and IS CAUGHT IN THE HEADLIGHTS OF A TRUCK THAT SWERVES AND HONKS-

The robot YELPS AND SCURRIES OFF THE ROAD, TRIPPING AND FALLING HEAD OVER HEELS INTO A MUDDY DITCH, and the truck heads off into the night.

It sits up, letting out a long, sad, adorable robotic sigh.

ALPHA 5
...Aye-yi-yi-yi-yi...

It shakes off the mud and turns, the red-lights focusing in on the warm, inviting lights of Trini’s house.

ALPHA 5
Oooooooooooooooooooooooooooo.

>IN THE VINEYARD

Jason passes the barn; there’s a smoking, sizzling hole straight through it the size of a BMW.

JASON
Whoa.

He rounds the barn, and walks cautiously a little further into the field, to the impact crater; all of the old grape-vines around it are flattened, and there’s some kind of orange foam everywhere.

Jason flashes his smartphone light around, surveying the area; it’s VERY spooky out here.

JASON
...So cool...

He touches some of the foam, then gets grossed out and flicks it off his hand. He raises his cell phone, and snaps a selfie with the crater, then takes it down to check it.

Zordon is sitting in the background of the picture.

Jason slooooooooowly turns. Zordon’s right there.

ZORDON
SCREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!

JASON^
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!

Jason punts Zordon like a soccer ball.

>IN TRINI’S HOUSE

Trini and Billy are having a panic attack in the kitchen, Trini holding a cell phone.

BILLY
Just give him five more minutes-

TRINI
So he can kill himself? You said it yourself, it could be dangerous-

BILLY
Yeah but if the cops come now he’ll get in trouble for trespassing-

TRINI
Why do you always defend him? All he does is get you trouble-

BILLY
Hey he’s your boyfriend-

TRINI
I told you he’s not my boyfriend anymo-

There’s a crash from somewhere in the house; the burglar alarm goes off. Both teens turn, tense.

BILLY
J- Jason?

>IN THE VINEYARD

Jason is running full speed through the vineyard, crashing through long rotted out plants, screaming; Zordon is scurrying along on the ground behind him, giving chase-

Jason burst out into a clearing, seeing the barn up ahead of him. There’s a noise behind him- frantic, he runs inside.

>IN TRINI’S HOUSE

Trini and Billy are creeping down a hallway towards the door to the garage; we can hear noises, metallic clanging and banging, from beyond the door.

Trini holds a hammer, Billy has some kind of trophy. Trini glances back at him, and they harshly whisper back and forth.

TRINI
What are you doing?

BILLY
What?

TRINI
That’s my track trophy!

BILLY
It was the nearest thing-

TRINI
That has emotional signifiga-

There’s a crash and a whirr from the garage, and both teens jump, startled. Trini very cautiously opens the door...

Revealing Alpha Five, rummaging through a storage bin.

ALPHA 5
GREETINGS.

Alpha 5 SCAMPERS ACROSS THE GARAGE TOWARDS BILLY AND TRINI-they scream and try to retreat, but Alpha crashes through the door in pursuit-

>WE INTERCUT

Between Jason, as he flees Zordon in the old abandoned barn, and Trini and Billy, as they run away, tearing carpets, knocking down framed photos, overturning tables and generally making a total mess of the house until-

Bam! Trini whacks Alpha with the hammer, and manages to kick him into the stove, trapping him, and then jumps away. Trini and Billy are both breathing hard, exhausted.

TRINI
Are you okay?

BILLY
I- yeah I-

Jason crashes through the screen door, and Billy SCREAMS.

Jason scrambles across the floor to Trini and Billy.

JASON
We’ve gotta get out of here, there’s some kind of-

TRINI
(looking at the door)
OH MY GOD.

Zordon has scurried inside, and climbed the wall up by the flatscreen television.

BILLY
It’s- it’s- it’s=-

JASON
Yeah.

Zordon knocks the TV loose, and it crashes to the floor, face up, cracked. Zordon lays two tentacles on it, and blue energy crackles through the television-

The television cycles rapidly through channels, hundreds of them, showing every possible program, the an internet browser opening and pouring rapidly through wikipedia until finally we come to a nature show, narrated by a confident, baritone narrator-

NARRATOR
For thousands of years, Earth was trapped in an ice age- age- age-AGEAGEAGEAGE-

The television shatters, light pouring out of it.

Zordon lights up like a glorious bioluminscent jellyfish, and the room is suddenly FLOODED WITH LIGHT-

It’s a hologram; an incredible projection streaming up from the television, that shows in beautiful animatic imagery, everything that the echoing, verbose borrowed voice of the nature show describes.

ZORDON (FROM TV)
TWENTY THOUSAND YEARS AGO THE DIVANTONIAN CRIMINAL RITA REPULSA FLED THE AUTHORITY OF THE ELTARIAN EMPIRE TO YOUR SOLAR SYSTEM-

WHAM! Jason knocks Zordon out with a frying pan. The holographic projection instantly vanishes.

Zordon lays on the ground, unconscious. Trini and Billy are both breathing hard. Jason chucks the frying pan.

BILLY
(long beat)
Is it dead?

SLAM TO:

The trunk of Trini’s car. Alpha 5 has been weighted down with electrical tape and cinder-blocks, while Zordon has been tied up and put into a cramped fish tank.

BILLY
School is in two hours.

TRINI
We have to...tell somebody-

BILLY
Tell them what? We weren’t even supposed to be there-

TRINI
Which is why we have to tell somebody, do you really wanna be the person who locked the first alien ever in the trunk of a car-

There’s a beat, and then Jason offers Trini his cell phone.

JASON
Okay. So who do you wanna call?

Zordon moves, and all three of the teenagers startle; Jason jumps forward and slams the trunk closed; he turns to Trini and Billy. All three silently stare at each other, clearly in shock.

JASON
Go to school. Act like everything’s normal. We’ll deal with this...later.
(beat)
Everything is under control.

BILLY
(beat)
...Is it though?

SLAM TO:

Jason lays on his bed, staring at the ceiling, wide awake at 6 AM, still processing.

INT. ANGEL GROVE HIGH - HALLWAY - MORNING

Trini walks up the hallway, clearly still tired. As she walks she can overhear kids talking at their lockers: “did you see that in the sky last night?” “a meteorite or a satellite or something-” “something’s wrong with my cell”

Trini keeps her head down.

INT. ANGEL GROVE HIGH - CLASSROOM

Billy sits in a poly-sci class; he keeps almost dozing off, but then notices a kid texting under the table. He seems frustrated; the phone isn’t working, and the screen flickers.

Billy watches him, interested, and then, suddenly-

INTERCOM
All students and faculty report to the gymnasium for an emergency assembly. Please remain calm.

>IN THE HALLWAYS

Jason, Billy and Trini head through the hallways in lines, headed to the assembly; there’s commotion, everyone talking nervously amongst themselves.

Zack is walking with the rest, looking at his smart phone.

The screen is blinking weirdly, and distorting.

INT. ANGEL GROVE HIGH - GYMNASIUM

The entirety of the school is gathered in the bleachers around the basketball court; there’s a palpable tension in the air, getting steadily worse.

PRINCIPAL KAPLAN, mid 40s, makes her way to a microphone on the court. Jason, Trini, Billy and Zack watch in the crowd.

PRINCIPAL
As many of you I’m sure have noticed, there appears to be a communications black-out throughout all of Angel Grove.

KID IN CROWD
Is this about that meteor last night?

There’s muttering in the crowd. Jason and Billy lock eyes, and look to Trini, who’s staring at her feet. Zack notices.

PRINCIPAL
Look, we don’t know yet. Since ten AM we’ve lost internet, cell service is down, and it would appear hard lines and radios aren’t working either. We’ve organized busses for everyone who doesn’t have a car, but right now, for the sake of safety and control, the police department is asking that all students return to their homes.

There’s a big commotion. Trini looks up to Jason.

 EXT. ANGEL GROVE HIGH - PARKING LOT

There’s a mass exodus going on; students are leaving in their own cars, but there’s also a dozen or so busses being used to transport students. It’s very hectic, and there’s a tension in the air.

Zack is kissing Angela goodbye as she gets onto a bus.

ZACK
Be careful, okay?

ANGELA
You be careful.

ZACK
I’ll be good, I’m going with the team.

.MOMENTS LATER

Zack approaches the vans taking the football team home, as they’re departing.

ZACK
Hey wait up-

It’s the same jerks from earlier.

JERK FOOTBALL PLAYER
Too slow, Taylor! Always too slow.

The slam the door as he approaches, laughing.

ZACK
Oh come on- come on, man!

JERK FOOTBALL PLAYER
You gonna cry? Guys, Mr. Sensitivity is gonna cry!

Zack chases the van for a moment, but it’s gone. He throws up his hands in frustration, and stands there in the emptying parking lot, when...

BILLY
(faintly, overheard)
-hit him with a frying pan-

Zack perks up, and looks across the lot to see Jason is following Trini, talking fervently, Billy in tow.

Zack focuses in on them: What?

>WITH OUR GANG

Trini is clearly not down to have this discussion.

JASON
We can’t just ignore this! I’m just saying there’s no way this isn’t connected-

BILLY
Nobody’s arguing that, but it isn’t safe to just let it out-

JASON
Maybe it could explain, maybe it could help us-

BILLY
Yeah and maybe it’s one of the ones causing it! This is OUR responsibility now!

Trini spins on Jason, furious.

TRINI
This is YOUR fault! I told you to call someone-

JASON
Right, cause I’ve got the Men in Black on speed-dial-

TRINI
(not letting up)
It was YOUR idea to break into the orchard, and it was YOUR idea to put him in the trunk!

JASON
WELL SOMEONE HAD TO DO SOMETHING-

Billy tugs Jason’s sleeve, and Jason turns, ready to yell.

Zack is standing right there. All three of them clam up instantly.

ZACK
...You guys okay?

TRINI
No.

JASON^
Yes.

BILLY
Maybe.

ZACK
So uh...
(awkward beat)
Who’d we put in the trunk?

EXT. POINT HAIM

Point Haim is a bluff out over the ocean, not unlike Malibu’s Point Dume. Kim’s Trans-Am is parked out on a dirt road, overlooking the ocean. A bonfire is still smoldering, and beer bottles are strewn around.

Kim is asleep half in, half out of the car. She groans awake, groggy and out of it, and immediately rubs her head, ouch, throbbing.

KIM
Yowch.

She sits up, and sees Bulk and Skull standing out on the cliff, staring at something in the ocean. She sighs, and gets in her car, turning it on.

The radio BLASTS DISTORTION, and Kim, in her sensitive state, yelps and turns it down, changing the station several times; distortion on every one.

She sighs and gets out, stumbling over to Bulk and Skull.

KIM
Hey morons, where is everybody?

They don’t answer, staring in awe at the ocean.

KIM
(shoving them aside)
What’re you looking ahhhh...

A massive, crackling pillar of red light has erupted out of the ocean and stretches up into the sky, where heat has created a perfect circular hole in the heavy cloud cover.

The clouds around it crackle with red electricity.

KIM
...That’s not normal...

INT. WASSERMAN VINEYARD - OLD BARN

Mid-afternoon sun streaks down through the dust in the old Wasserman barn. Billy’s minivan is parked out front, while Trini’s car has been pulled into the barn.

Jason, Billy, Trini and Zack stand around the trunk, all of them nervously wielding old, rusty farm implements.

JASON
Okay, on three, we pop the trunk.

BILLY
And say what, “we’re very sorry-”

JASON
Just be ready.

The teens talk in hushed tones.

ZACK
Be ready. For the squid. Right.

JASON
You said you’d be cool about helping us with this-

ZACK
I just wanted a ride, man. Why the hell did you lock the alien in the trunk in the first place?

BILLY
We were panicked, it was- like, okay, yes, looking back, it was not a perfect strategy-

JASON
I didn’t hear any better ideas.

TRINI
Yes you did!

JASON
One...Two...Three-

The trunk pops open and-

ZORDON COMES FLYING OUT, knocking Jason to the ground- turns and trips Trini, flooring her- Zack is about to do something, but freezes, clearly in shock, and Zordon JUMP KICKS HIM in the chest, ZACK GOES DOWN-

Zordon strikes a karate pose at Billy, who’s so startled he falls backwards, scrambling up against the wall.

BILLY
WE’RE VERY SORRY! WE’RE VERY SORRY!

Zordon rapidly shifts focus between the teens, clearly tense.

JASON
(dazed)
We were scared, we didn’t mean to hurt you- we didn’t know what to do-

BILLY
(quietly)
A lot of “we’s” there Jason-

Satisfied that they aren’t a threat, Zordon suddenly turns and climbs onto the trunk, as Alpha 5 sheepishly crawls out.

Zordon opens the top of Alpha 5, revealing an incredibly beautiful holographic series of displays, offering all manner of alien information.

Billy and Jason exchange shaky whispers.

BILLY
What’s it doing?

JASON
I don’t know- checking its texts?

Trini edges forward, hands out.

TRINI
(beat)
Something is happening- all of our communications are being shut down, we- we thought that you might-

Zordon’s voice blasts out the car radio; calm, confident, shockingly human. Think Tommy Lee Jones in The Fugitive.

ZORDON
Your planet is in grave danger from a criminal named Rita Repulsa. She was locked away a long time, but she’s free again now, and I have to stop her.

The teens all startle.

BILLY
You speak- you speak English?

ZORDON
I speak everything. I read your cloud database, primitive technology.
(re: Alpha’s screens)
The global black-out is her first move. Next she’ll try to retake the scepter, then her ship, then the show’s over-

ZACK
S- slow down, man- what is GOING ON right now-

BILLY
He attacked us-

Zordon laughs, exasperated, tinkering with Alpha 5.

ZORDON
I “attacked you”-

JASON
Okay, maybe not “attacked” us, but YOU WERE NOT BEING CHILL-

ZORDON
It’s my own fault. I should’ve planned, I should’ve known that-
(shakes his head)
We need to act fast.

TRINI
Who are you?

Zordon turns, standing up on the roof of the car.

ZORDON
The robot in your trunk is my taskmasker adjunct, Alpha 5. And my name...

ZORDON
(beat)
is Zordon.

Lightning crackles in the clouds outside.

EXT. ANGEL GROVE - ALL OVER

It’s starting to rain. The clouds in the sky are getting worse. A few people here and there are out, staring at the red pillar of light from the ocean. Police cars slowly patrol the streets.

Power in the town is fluctuating; even the streetlights as...

>ON THE COAST

Kim drives the coast in her Trans-Am. The cliffs and beach-side are beautiful, but the ominous atmosphere of the beam from the ocean and the drizzling rain are a powerful double punch.

Kim’s still trying her cell, frustrated, when she notices something out on the beach; something breaking water. She pulls over behind some rocks, then creeps out to take a look.

The shape slowly lifts out of the ocean; it’s massive, spikey, big as an elephant, water pouring off of it in gouts of steam. We don’t get a look, but Kim does.

KIM
No way.

The thing throws back its head and ROARS, a horrible raspy sound! Kim falls, startled, then scrambles back to her car.

INT. WASSERMAN VINEYARD - OLD BARN

The rain is really pouring down now. The teens have relaxed a little, and are intently listening to Zordon.

ZACK
So you’re like...a soldier?

ZORDON
The Eltarian Power Rangers aren’t soldiers; we’re more like an intergalactic police force. A multispecies alliance comprised of hundreds of teams, maintaining peace throughout a large part of the galaxy.

BILLY
Riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight. Of course, yes, the “Power Rangers-”

TRINI
And they protect Earth?

ZORDON
...No.
(beat)
Twenty thousand years ago, my team was dispatched to your solar system to catch a criminal named Rita Repulsa. Repulsa was the leader of a notorious band of mercenaries called The Dominators, who’d been causing chaos and fomenting the seeds of interstellar anarchy for a warlord known as Zedd, who was trying to overthrow the Eltarian alliance.

ZACK
This is really heavy.

JASON
I’m still stuck on “Rita Repulsa.”

ZORDON
We were able to overpower Repulsa, iand disable her ship, trapping her and the rest of The Dominators in deep-freeze on the dark side of your moon. But...Our ship was destroyed as well, and...my entire team was killed in the battle.
(beat, sad)
I went into suspended-animation and waited for rescue. ...I guess it never came.

Thunder booms ominously.

ZORDON
The Dominators aren’t invaders, they’re criminals, wanted for terrible crimes all over the galaxy. And what they’re doing on your world isn’t an invasion, it’s a heist.

The teens react as Zordon accesses some displays on Alpha 5, which show what he’s describing in beautiful animatics.

ZORDON
Pieces of my Command Ship are spread all over your planet, abandoned for thousands of years. The largest chunk, the Command Center, is here, in your city. If Repulsa accesses it, she can use her scepter to activate the engines and return to Lord Zedd’s empire. Something must’ve triggered the Command Center’s security fields-

BILLY
Wait that- that’s at the museum.

Indeed, the animatic is showing the Crescent Scepter.

ZORDON
What? The Crescent Scepter? You know where this is?

BILLY
(aghast)
The Pastel Canyon dig...
(processing)
It and a couple of other artifacts were brought up at a dig just outside of town-

ZORDON
How long ago did this happen?

BILLY
I mean- weeks- months-

ZORDON
This is very, very bad.
(beat)
Can you take me to where they brought it up?

JASON
Yes.

BILLY^
No!

ZORDON
We have to secure the Command Center before she can find it, and at all costs stop her from getting the Crescent Scepter; with it she has access to the full extent of her powers.

ZACK
(whispered)
-Powers, okay she’s got “powers”-

ZORDON
Unearthing the scepter must’ve been what gave her the boost she needed to break herself and the Dominators out of deep-freeze. The scepter holds part of her life-force, and feeds on energy, like her; bringing it out into the open woke the damn thing up; I’d hoped it was lost forever when the ship crashed, but if it’s awake, she’s awake. If she gets her claws on it, she’ll be unstoppable.

BILLY
Wait “we” what do you mean “we”

ZORDON
You need to help me get to the Command Center, so I can send an SOS back to Eltar. Call another Power Ranger team. They’ll be able to stop Repulsa, protect your planet.

The teens exchange nervous looks.

BILLY
But how are we supposed to trust you-

Zordon enters a beeping code into the top of Alpha 5, which blossoms beautifully into the MORPHILUS, a display case in which rest five beautiful ornamental tokens.

Zordon picks one up, staring at it lovingly.

ZORDON
The same way I’m going to have to trust you. We don’t have time to waste.
(beat)
This is a power coin; hyper-dense nanotechnology; it will allow you access to Ranger armor. Only a previous holder of a coin can pass them on. The coin will scan your psionic energy, building you an armor.

ZORDON
This armor will offer protection, magnify your reflexes, and enhance your natural talents. Holding a Ranger coin is a great responsibility, but if we’re going to stop Repulsa I don’t have any other choice-.

Jason reaches out and grabs the Ranger coin from Zordon, startling both Zordon and other teens. There’s a crackle of red electricity as he holds it in his hand.

BILLY
CAN YOU PLEASE NOT JUST KEEP GRABBING THINGS FROM THE ALIEN-

ZORDON
(intense)
Do not use it unless you absolutely have to. Rita doesn’t know I’m here, we can’t let her figure that out. Just get the scepter, and if you encounter anything strange, retreat. Try not to be seen, and use the coin ONLY as a last resort.

JASON
Billy.

Jason grabs a second coin out of the Morphilus, slapping it into Billy’s hand; there’s crackle of blue electricity.

ZORDON
Whoa, hey, can we not get over-excited with this, these aren’t toys-

JASON
You said this things is on the way, right? And if it gets the scepter, that’s bad?
(to Billy)
Take him to Pastel Canyon. I’ll go to the museum.

Billy stares at the coin. Jason turns, awkwardly.

JASON
Trini, can you give me a ride?

>OUTSIDE

Moments later, Billy intercepts Jason and Trini getting into Trini’s car.

BILLY
Why should we listen to him?

JASON
He’s a cop-

BILLY
He’s a freakin alien! For all we know he’s tricking us, for all we know he’s the only one invading earth; he wants you to ROB a MUSEUM, that thing he gave you could be a bomb-

JASON
You’ve got one too, now-

BILLY
Well I didn’t want it, I don’t want it! We can’t just- I mean, there has to be someone we can-

JASON
(sincere)
The phones don’t work. It’s like he said, we’re all the planet has got-

BILLY
Yes, according to him and his pet flying saucer- I’m just saying, we should take him to the police, or-

JASON
And what if we’re wrong? What then? What if that Reeto thing gets in its UFO and starts blowin crap up-

BILLY
You mean the UFO we’re giving him a carpool to, that UFO-

Billy’s car starts, startling all of them, Zordon talking through the radio as he, Zack and Alpha 5 exit the barn.

ZORDON
Every second you spend second guessing me or locking me in car trunks is a second they get ahead. SO EXCUSE ME if I’m a little impatient with your paranoia. NOW GET IN THE CAR.

Billy and Jason exchange a tense look.

Seconds later, both car doors slam. We’re off to the races.

INT. ANGEL GROVE POLICE STATION

The waiting room out front is packed with people, complaining about emergencies, that their phones don’t work, etc.

Jason’s dad is in the bullpen, loudly talking with other officers; there are twenty or so men here, all look nervous.

MR. SCOTT
The car-radios are still down, we get spread out too thin and lose touch, the whole force will break down.

POLICE OFFICER
There must be some kinda system, right? We set up meeting points. I mean if the phones and internet stay down much longer people are going to start to panic.

POLICE LIEUTENANT
Yeah, I mean, what is this, is it the military?? We still don’t even know what’s happening, and we’ve got no word from the outside, we have to-

A cop bursts in.

FRANTIC COP
We’ve got a red-light at the Pacific Museum.

POLICE OFFICER
I thought all the communications were down-

Mr. Scott gets up, grabbing his jacket.

MR. SCOTT
We’re hooked up directly to the museum’s security system. You don’t think this whole thing could be some kind of heist...

POLICE LIEUTENANT
Get everyone together, let’s stop this before it starts.

EXT. THE ANGEL GROVE PACIFIC MUSEUM

Rain is trickling down as Trini’s car pulls up. Jason looks over to the museum, where a break in alarm is sounding; the big glass front doors are shattered.

TRINI
That’s not good.

JASON
It’s okay. I got this.

TRINI^
But Zordon said-

JASON
I got this.

Trini’s quiet and Jason starts to get out.

TRINI
You don’t know what’s in there.

JASON
I’ve got this, it’ll be okay. He said the bad aliens don’t even know we’re here, right?

TRINI
Do you realize how crazy you sound?

He looks at her for a moment, then leans in and kisses her.

JASON
Just trust me.

Jason gets out, pulling his jacket up over his head as he runs out towards the museum. Trini fidgets, nervous.

EXT. THE PASTEL CANYON DIG - CONCURRENT

The Pastel Canyon dig is a big excavation into the side of a canyon out in the rolling hills to the east of the City.

Zack has gone up to a scenic overlook, staring out at the red beam from the ocean as the rain beats down.

Zack notices a string of police lights twinkling in the far distance in town.

Down by the excavation, Zordon is working on Alpha 5, while Billy looks on, nervously fidgeting with his power coin.

ZORDON
It’s lucky we got here when we did. Two or three more weeks digging your people would’ve found it.

BILLY
Found what?

ZORDON
Stand back.

Zordon triggers something on Alpha 5 as Zack comes rushing down the hill to them.

ZACK
Hey, there’s something going on in town, I saw cop cars-

The ground under them begins rumbling, and then, in a beautiful sequence, several giant chunks of the earth and the canyon wall fall away, revealing the jagged, tubular top portion of THE COMMAND CENTER.

Zordon, unfased by this, approaches it, a beautiful and complex entry-way crackling open; high-tech, but immensely old, creaking with the dust of forty thousand years.

BILLY
D- does he expect us to go in there with him?

Alpha 5 lets out a loud whoop of excitement from behind them, pushing forward, shepherding our boys towards the entrance.

ZACK
Imma take that as a yes.

.EXT/INT. THE ANGEL GROVE PACIFIC MUSEUM - CONCURRENT

Jason comes up to the shattered doors, slowing down when he notices some kind of grey glop on the broken glass.

JASON
...What...

He edges inside, nearly deafened by the alarm, moving through the darkened museum following footprints of the grey goop.

He doesn’t notice, but behind him, next to the creepy disembodied, grey-head sculpture, a second head has appeared.

He turns to look, and it ducks out of sight. Jason shakes off the creeps and steps up on to the huge scepter exhibit.

He pulls it...Pushes it...pulls it- CRASH, the huge scepter falls down onto him-

INT. THE COMMAND CENTER - CATWALKS - CONCURRENT

Billy, Zack and Zordon follow Alpha 5, who’s lit up like a lantern. The light exposes a series of catwalks leading to a central hub in a MASSIVE cavernous chamber.

The drop beneath them is at least a hundred feet.

ZACK
This is only a piece of the ship that crashed?

ZORDON
Yes, the Command center. All that stuff you can see down below us is the emergency engine.

BILLY
What’s your plan? I mean, how can you power any of this?

ZORDON
My species have a high amount of psionic energy.

ZACK
Psionic what?

ZORDON
The energy that flows through all living things. Most Eltarian technology is based on interfacing directly with living beings. It’s how I can communicate in your language so easily.
(beat)
It will drain me, but I should be able to get some of the auxiliary systems online, enough to call for help anyway. I’m amazed it has any power left at all, but we’re lucky it’s not much.

ZACK
Why lucky?

ZORDON
Well, the automated security syst-

.A HULKING ROBOT COMES PLUMMETING OUT OF CEILING, LANDING ON

THE CATWALK BETWEEN THE HUMANS AND ZORDON, WHOA. Before they can even react, it ZAPS Zack with a stun beam, and SMACKS BILLY, knocking him off the edge of the cat-walk!

He catches on with one hand, DANGLING ABOVE THE DROP-

EXT. THE ANGEL GROVE PACIFIC MUSEUM - CONCURRENT

Trini, sitting in her car, hears sirens, and looks up to see that six Angel Grove police cars are blazing up the road towards her. Uh-oh.

>INSIDE

Jason struggles out from under the scepter, picking it up, and hears the sirens outside.

JASON
Oh no w-

Jason turns to find himself face to face with a PUTTY.

PUTTIES are amorphous, gaunt, nearly featureless humanoids with an eerie boneless way of moving, whose puckered faces, hollow, glowing red-eyes and gooey consistency make them as disgusting as they are menacing.

Jason stands staring in numb shock at the Putty; it wraps its hands around the scepter and tugs. Jason tugs back. They tug of war for a second and then-

JASON
BACK OFF MAN-

An arm shoots out of the center of the putty’s chest, knocking Jason away.

JASON
What the hell-

The Putty NAILS Jason in the chest with a perfectly executed spin-kick that LAUNCHES Jason backwards, sending him crashing into the display of the ancient Putty-Head.

>IN THE SPACESHIP

The security robot is trying to attack Alpha 5 and Zordon, who are frantically crawling away. The robot is clunkier and less coordinated than it seemed; the years haven’t been kind to it, and it’s clumsily smashing holes in the catwalk.

BILLY
ZACK! ZACK, HELP ME!

Zack is still dazed- Billy’s failing to pull himself up-

>AT THE MUSEUM

Jason groans in pain, dazed, covered in little cuts as he pushes himself up in the wrecked display. The Putty, dragging the scepter, is over by the Giant Gold Armor.

Jason sees the Putty reach into itself, pulling out a squirmy-blue ball of fur. Almost like Gizmo from Gremlins. The putty sticks the fur-ball into the armor, and then steps away, dragging the scepter towards the door.

Jason falters a moment, clearly afraid, but then pulls it together, realizing he can’t let it get away, and pushes himself to his feet, chasing the putty.

JASON
Hey! Get back here, you’re not getting away with that-

The Putty backhands him, and walks out the front door to see-

EXT. THE ANGEL GROVE PACIFIC MUSEUM - CONTINUOUS

Eight police cars are parked in loose formation in the parking lot, rain pouring down. The cops are all out, Mr. Scott raising a megaphone.

MR. SCOTT
This is the Angel Grove PD. Put the- thing down, and put your hands behind your head!

Jason, recovering inside, hears his dad’s voice.

JASON
Oh no, this is bad, this is so bad-

The putty, startled by the noise and sirens, drops the scepter, drops its jaw impossibly low and SCREAMS, charging the police!

They open fire but the bullets do NOTHING, splashing harmlessly into the putty’s goopy body- it morphs its arms into a spiked club and a whipping tentacle and ATTACKS!

Jason rushes out and grabs the scepter as the Putty begins DISMANTLING THE COPS- it’s like the T-1000 from Terminator knows kung-fu, these guys DON’T STAND A CHANCE.

Jason stands frozen; he could escape, Zordon told him not to morph, but that thing is bearing down on his dad...

JASON
Okay. Let’s do this.

The coin TRIGGERS, bursting out and ENVELOPING the unprepared Jason, knocking him out of frame.

>IN THE SPACESHIP

BILLY
ZACK! WAKE UP! ZACK!

Zack rouses, and sees Billy. He dives to help, but it’s too late- Billy DROPS, plummeting out into the abyss- MIDFALL, BILLY PUNCHES HIS POWER-COIN-

Up on the catwalk, Zack, horrified, stares down after Billy-but HERE COMES THE ROBOT- Zack ducks under its swinging arms and makes a run for it-

>AT THE MUSEUM

Mr. Scott is showing down with putty, firing round after round into it harmlessly as it stalks towards him.

MR. SCOTT
Come on! GO DOWN! GO DOWN-

The putty is suddenly SLAMMED OUT OF THE WAY. In its place stand, Jason, in The Red Ranger Armor. He is awesome.

MR. SCOTT
Dear god.

Jason turns to look at his father, and the putty ATTACKS!

Jason’s fight with the putty is brief, but amazing; Jason’s karate abilities are heightened to an absurd degree.

He’s Iron-Man and Neo as the same person. He’s able to block everything the putty does.

JASON
Not so tough now, huh?

Jason rips off the putty’s arm and starts smacking him with it; the putty roars at him, and he rips off its leg, and smacks it with that too.

JASON
Oh, god, this is, this is just embarrassing. I thought you guys were supposed to be tough?

The putty hisses and dives at him; Jason KICKS IT IN HALF.

The putty splatters apart instantly.

JASON
WOO! YEAH!

Jason punches through the hood of a cop car in excitement.

He then turns and kicks a light post in half, before turning and doing a triple back-flip.

The cops, beaten and dazed, stare in confusion at Jason as he tests out his new powers.

COP
What’s it...what’s it doing?

MR. SCOTT
...Jumping around?...

There’s a loud shattering noise from the front of the museum, and the cops all look away from the “super hero,” to see...

GOLDAR, now wearing the Golden armor, has crashed through the front of the museum; covered in blue fur, a nine foot tall humanoid baboon/lion hybrid in medieval armor, Goldar spits in the face of the mundane grey monster designs of blockbusters.

JASON
(quietly)
Oh crap. That’s a big dude.

And now is as good a time as any to tell you, as a Dominator, what’s special about Goldar isn’t the effects, it’s the character. We immediately feel his verbose, cocksure, grandiose presence; a brute who considers himself nobility.

GOLDAR
HELLO, HUMANS!

Jason stumbles backwards, terrified, but then looks around, seeing all the scared police officers.

JASON
Da- OFFICER. Get your men out of here.

MR. SCOTT
I- you- yes, right, everybody fall back, fall back!

The cops, helping the injured, retreat in terror, fleeing into the rain, leaving their cars, as Goldar laughs, confidently walking down the steps.

Jason hurriedly goes to pick up the scepter, and Goldar notices him.

As Goldar talks, we hear what Jason hears, (english, translated by his suit), but momentarily also what the cops hear: incoherent roaring.

He seems...amused?

GOLDAR
A Red Ranger. Amazing, the Eltarians have spread their stink of “peace” all the way to Earth.

Jason perks up, trying to think of something to say, as Goldar strides towards him, rain pouring down, the scene lit in the flashing red and blue of police lights.

GOLDAR
Why aren’t you running, with the monkeys?

Jason’s scared, but it’s not in his nature to back down.

JASON
Why would I run from you, you stupid- blue- ...cat!

Trini, in her car hidden in the darkness, stares in horror.

TRINI
Jason what are you doing, no no no-

GOLDAR
You don’t recognize Goldar the Griffarius? Do they really teach you so little at the academy?
(flatly)
Hand over the scepter, now.

Jason looks back to Trini’s car. Considers running. No.

JASON
That’s not happening.

Jason assumes a fighting pose. Goldar pouts mockingly.

GOLDAR
Oh, really? Okay, sorry, I’ll just-

Goldar SMASHES JASON INTO THE SIDE OF A POLICE CAR, WHAMMO.

JASON VS. GOLDAR is a bombastic, brutal, but wildly fun to watch back and forth; David against Goliath.

Jason’s enhanced super-human karate seems to annoy Goldar more than hurt him; the monster’s sheer brute strength makes him MORE than a match for the rookie Ranger.

>IN THE SPACESHIP

Zack has reached the COMMAND CENTER, a hub of depowered high tech equipment. He scrambles behind a terminal.

The robot comes crashing in, and begins searching. Uh oh.

>AT THE MUSEUM

Goldar finishes pummeling Jason, knocks him to his knees.

Trini watches in her car, in absolute horror. Goldar grabs Jason by the head, and rips at his chest, exposing his morphing coin.

GOLDAR
Pathetic. I’ve never seen a Ranger so puny and worthless. Your coin will make a great addition to my-

Goldar stops upon seeing the coin, shocked.

GOLDAR
But...This is Zordon’s coin.

Goldar RIPS OFF THE FRONT OF JASON’S HELMET, exposing his terrified face beneath. Goldar looks genuinely shocked.

GOLDAR
You’re...human.
(beat)
A human Power Ranger? Incredible!

Jason struggles, but Goldar is too strong; which suddenly doesn’t matter, because Goldar drops him to the street.

Jason gasping, scrambles for the front of the helmet.

GOLDAR
Go on! Get it. I’ll give you one more chance.

Jason grabs the face-mask, which automatically rebonds to the helmet, screams in anger- charges Goldar- WHAM! Bad idea.

Goldar belly laughs as Jason frantically crawls under a police car.

Goldar leans down, tipping up the car.

GOLDAR
Enough games! An admirable effort, but you won’t live to see your planet DESTROYED. It’s time to-

Goldar is suddenly lit by headlights; he turns confused- WHAM TRINI’S CAR NAILS GOLDAR, SENDING HIM UP AND OVER THE HOOD, CRUMPLING THE FRONT AND SHATTERING THE WINDSHIELD.

Jason looks up to see Trini wide-eyed behind the wheel.

TRINI
Get in.

As Trini’s damaged car screeches off into the night, Goldar stands, slightly dazed but otherwise completely unharmed.

He looks: the scepter is gone.

GOLDAR
RrrrrrHumans.

INT. THE COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS

Zack is hiding behind a console, when he sees Zordon sneaking along the ceiling, moving with practiced tactical grace. The robot SUDDENLY COMES LURCHING AROUND THE CORNER, TARGETING LIGHTS FALLING OVER ZACK-

Zordon DROPS DOWN IN FRONT OF IT, protective of Zack when-THERE’S AN EXPLOSION OF SPARKS AS THE ROBOT’S HEAD IS TORN OFF- IT FALLS, REVEALING

The Blue Ranger. Zordon and Zack both breathe a sigh of relief, and the Ranger helmet deactivates, revealing Billy.

BILLY
Okay. I’m not...I’m not gonna lie. That was really, very cool.

EXT. THE PASTEL CANYON DIG - SHORTLY THEREAFTER

Trini’s car comes skidding up, sliding in the mud from the rain; the scepter hangs out the window from the backseat.

The car splutters badly; hitting Goldar messed it up.

Jason, unmorphed, gets out, pulling the scepter out with him; Jason actually looks pretty beat up, and stumbles, but Trini catches him.

JASON
I’m fine- the suit protected me I-

TRINI
You don’t look fine, Jason-

JASON^
Come on, we’ve gotta get this
inside-

TRINI
(grabbing his arm)
Wait-

Jason reacts sharply.

JASON
I know I messed up! But I didn’t have a choice, I know you don’t get this, but sometimes there are situations you can’t CONTROL-

He notices that she’s silent, and shaking.

JASON
...What’s-

TRINI
I- ...I don’t want to break up.

JASON
What?

TRINI
When that thing was hitting you, I knew, I’m sorry I’ve been freaking out about stuff-

JASON
Trini, is now really the time to-

TRINI
THERE’S A LOT GOING ON RIGHT NOW I’M IN A REALLY WEIRD PLACE-

The Security Robot’s LIGHTS SHINE ONTO THEM- Trini and Jason yelp, Trini moving in front of the injured Jason.

ALPHA 5
HELLO! HI THERE! IT’S ME!

The Golden Disk of Alpha 5 has attached itself to the robot body, acting as a head. Trini and Jason tentatively relax.

JASON
You’re...bigger.

ALPHA 5
YES. WOW, SO TALL!
(sees scepter)
OOOOoooo.

INT. ANGEL GROVE POLICE STATION

It’s even more crowded than before, now with injured people from various household accidents, complaining loudly.

Kim is up at the front desk, furiously arguing with Officer Davis, who’s treating her like a complete child.

KIM
Have you not seen that thing out there in the ocean? Have you not noticed there is something very definitely MESSED UP happening!?

OFFICER DAVIS
I’m aware, but MIGHT YOU open your mind that we have been inundated with requests for help all day, and reports of a “sea monster” by a pink haired juvenile delinquent don’t rank high on our list of-

KIM
What’s my hair got to do with it? I’m trying to help, you jack-ass-

OFFICER DAVIS
Miss Hart if you don’t sit down and shut up I’ll be forced to detain you for disorderly conduct-

KIM
DUDE, HAS THE WORLD GONE CRAZY, THIS IS STRAIGHT UP FASCISM!

A couple of the older people in the station yell at her to shut up and stop making a scene.

OFFICER DAVIS
Okay that’s it.

Officer Davis heads around the counter to confront Kim when the front door bursts open; it’s Jason’s dad, helping to carry a bloodied, injured officer.

MR. SCOTT
Davis we need you outside, now. We’ve got injured-

OFFICER DAVIS^
What? What happened-

MR. SCOTT
We were attacked by some kind of monster at the museum.

Kim immediately helps Mr. Scott with the injured officer, giving Davis a “told-you-so” glance.

OFFICER DAVIS
Sir are you-

MR. SCOTT
I am dead serious, we have fifteen incapacitated officers outside who’ll confirm. Any luck on communications?

OFFICER DAVIS
No, sir, we’re completely dark-

Kim carefully, quietly takes the utility belt off the injured officer, leaving the gun behind.

MR. SCOTT
Then we need you outside helping our people out of the rain-

There’s a rumbling. Everything in the police station starts shaking, glass rattling in its frame.

MR. SCOTT
Oh god. What now?

Kim, unstoppably curious, finishes affixing the police belt as she heads out the front door to

EXT. ANGEL GROVE - MAINSTREET - CONTINUOUS

Kim steps out, moving through the retreating injured cops, to see THREE FIREBALLS STREAK DOWN THROUGH THE SKY-

One hits up the street from her, BOOM! BOOM KIM GOES DOWN-

INT. THE COMMAND CENTER

Power in the Command Center is slowly flickering to life; beautiful, candy colors, yellows and oranges giving the area a weirdly hearth-y feeling.

Trini and Jason, followed by Alpha 5, who carries the scepter, are headed towards the hub. Billy rushes out to greet them.

BILLY
What happened- Zordon said you ran into trouble-

JASON
What? How does he know-

BILLY
Alpha can track the coins from the Command Center; Zordon’s pretty pissed off, Jason.

JASON
Wait why do you look so happy? Did-

BILLY
I morphed, yeah.

JASON
Did all the little- and you-I was jumping all over the place in the air and punched through a car- OH that’s PERFECT-

BILLY^
Oh my god it’s like being Superman- I fell like three hundred feet- I was fine and just ran up a wall- YEAH! No, SO COOL-

ZORDON (O.S.)
Was I not clear enough for you?

The booming voice comes over the intercoms, startling both excited teenagers, as they move into THE COMMAND CENTER.

A massive column of light and energy looms over the space, in which hangs the face of a man both handsome and rugged; it’s like some Wild West Marshal version of the Wizard of Oz.

Zordon’s Human Face.

TRINI
Zordon?

JASON
You’re...bigger.

ZORDON
I explicitly told you to stay out of combat, stay out of sight-

JASON
Someone I cared about was in danger, I didn’t have choice-

ZORDON
Saving your father wasn’t the problem. Why did you fight Goldar?

JASON
...You saw that?
(shakes it off)
Hey I got the scepter didn’t I- wh-I’ve got my own questions for you! Like...Why are you a big head?

ZORDON
My true body is plugged into the mainframe; it’s easier for me to communicate like this. The systems are still charging, and then we can call for help and solve this mess-

Zack enters, climbing up a ladder from down below.

ZACK
Hey those panels down there are all glowing orange, just like you said-Jason, Trini, hey-

ZORDON
Good. That means the emergency power is coming online, at least for now. Soon we’ll be able to send out the message to the-

JASON
Why did Goldar say our planet was going to be destroyed?

There’s a dead, flat silence.

BILLY
Gol- dar, did I miss something-

ZACK^
Goldar Goldar Goldar uhhh

TRINI
I thought you said they were criminals? You said they just broke out, why would they want to destroy Earth-

ZORDON
(reluctant)
They don’t “want to destroy Earth.”

A hologram explodes from the center of the room, showing everything Zordon says.

ZORDON
My psionic energy is enough to get a few of the systems online, but the ship’s been dead a long time.
(beat)
Repulsa wants to use this as her escape vehicle, to leave this galaxy and rejoin Zedd’s empire. To start the transpace engines they need to leech heat and energy from a much larger source. Your planet’s core.

BILLY
But...How will the planet survive that?

ZORDON
It won’t.

In the hologram, the earth implodes horrifically, coming apart like a cracked egg. The teens all react with horror, Trini gasping audibly.

ZACK
W- Why the hell didn’t you tell us about this in the first place-

ZORDON
Because I didn’t want to scare you! We can call the Power Rangers and stop this madness, I’ve done it before-

JASON
The last time you tried that your said the whole team died! How come you didn’t kill them the first time you beat them? And how come Goldar isn’t afraid of you?

ZORDON
What? You spoke to him?

JASON
(sheepish)
He- he saw your coin- I took out a gray one of them no problem, but-

ZORDON
That was a putty, it was nothing-

ALPHA 5
Landings detected in Angel Grove.

ZORDON
No, not now...

BILLY
What’s going on?

ZORDON
We’ve lost the element of surprise. Repulsa knows I’m here. She’s called in The Dominators.

EXT. ANGEL GROVE - MAINSTREET

Toxic looking black, green, purple smoke is billowing up from the craters, choking the air; it’s apocalyptic.

Kim slowly shakes herself awake; she’s right near the crater, and sees an older man struggling to stand even closer. She scrambles to him, pulling him to his feet.

KIM
Get outta here!

The man limps away; the street is nearly deserted, and something is stirring in the crater. Kim quickly ducks behind a flipped car, peeking over as...

BABOO, an elegant, gangly bird-like humanoid, somehow aristocratic in both his manner and design, pulls himself up out of the crater.

SQUATT, a fat, blue-skinned troll in a hodge-podge of armor, crawls up over Baboo, knocking him down.

The two of them yell back and forth at each other; Baboo squawking angrily, and Squatt arguing back in burpy, grunting vocalizations.

Baboo pokes Squatt in the eye, and he spins around, unholstering a laser-blaster type-shotgun.

Baboo ducks- KAZA-BOOM! The laser blast goes wild, blowing up a store behind him, leaving only smoking rubble. The dispute between the two aliens is instantly resolved, both of them loudly celebrating at the prospect of destruction.

It’s instantly funny; hell, these two might even be cute if they weren’t so scary looking.

Baboo and Squatt open fire with laser blasters into the buildings all around them, causing mass destruction and chaos, laughing and having a good time.

Goofy as they are, they’re nothing funny about the destruction; people run and scream, and Kim sinks down lower, shaking, when-

-Something leaps across the roofs of the buildings behind her, and Kim has to frantically crawl into a fallen tree to avoid being seen as the new alien approaches.

KIM
No way...

SCORPINA, a hyper-feminine monstrosity, far scarier than the doofuses; she looks like a female version of the Predator, mixed with the nastier bits of an eight-foot tall scorpion.

Baboo and Squatt quickly try to straighten themselves and look dapper, bowing low to Scorpina.

Scorpina hisses, menacing him with her stinger, when-

GOLDAR
Greetings Scorpina. Been a long time.

Goldar approaches, casually smashing a car out of his way.

Scorpina purrs.

GOLDAR
Repulsa nears. Where is the vehicle?

Baboo presses some buttons on a device, and an armored, floating vehicle lifts off out of the crater; it’s huge, a hovering battleship shaped roughly like a giant tarantula.

This is the ARACHNASTROYER.

Baboo steps forward, plaintively gesturing to Goldar.

GOLDAR
I don’t have the scepter. Not yet. I ran into some trouble.
(beat)
Zordon is alive.

Scorpina snarls in anger.

REPULSA (O.S.)
It doesn’t matter.

The growling, distinctly alien female voice is unmistakably malevolent; the sort of voice you’d expect the devil’s wife to have.

All four of the Dominators fall into a bow, as Kim turns to see a hulking silhouette approaching through the smoke, eyes glowing orange.

REPULSA
He cannot stop us. Zordon will burn. This planet will die.

INT. THE COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS

The four teens stare in horror at a holographic image of the destruction in Angel Grove.

TRINI
What- what do we do-

BILLY^
Stop them! Do something!

ZORDON
Alpha, initiate a global scan for the Zords.

BILLY
“zords?”

ZORDON
(distracted)
The Zords are robots, giant by your standards, that combine to form a superweapon, the Megazord.

ZACK
...Is it possible that I’m asleep right now-

The machines beeps.

ALPHA 5
Iiiiiiiiii GOT ONE.

A hologram of a massive robot pops up, displaying a map of Earth; the jungle, somewhere in South East Asia.

ZORDON
Looks like the Red Zord is the only one still above ground. Jason, it corresponds to your coin, so you’ll have to go get it.

ZACK
Why’s it look like a dinosaur?

ZORDON
The Zords are handcrafted; custom made for the Ranger Team they’re assigned to, modelled after creatures from the galaxy they’re sent to protect. The Tyrannosaurus used to be mine.
(beat)
The ship doesn’t have much energy...It’ll slow down the sending of the SOS, but we should be able to teleport you from here.

JASON
Teleport? Like whoosh zoom teleport?

ALPHA 5
WHOOSH ZOOM!

ZORDON
Once you find the Zord, if you activate it, it should be able to recall itself to the Command Center..

JASON
So- yeah- this shoulda been the plan all along. I rev it up, beam it back here and just squash them? Summon up the Mega-whatever and kick some-

ZORDON
Humans couldn’t possibly operate Zords, much less summon the Megazord. You’d need a fully functional ranger team, and the zords interface directly with your psionic energy; humans are far too simple of life-forms; the strain on your life-force would be too much.

JASON
How do you know? Has a human ever even tried?

TRINI
Jason-

JASON^
What?

BILLY
You’re saying one of these Zords could scare off Repulsa?

ZORDON
One of them, no. All of them, yes. Every Zord has a function to recall the others; teleport them in from anywhere in world, as long as all five coins are present. We bring back the Zords. Make it look like I’ve got a full team.
(beat)
The Dominators will be looking for me, now that they know I have the scepter.

JASON
I can’t just teleport halfway across the world alone- Billy, come with me-

BILLY
I- you- I don’t-

JASON
You’re scared-

BILLY
Damn it I’m sick of you calling me a coward Jason-

JASON
Then maybe you shouldn’t have acted like one for the last fifteen years-

BILLY
You being “brave” is the reason the Dominators are here in the first place, if you hadn’t attacked Goldar they wouldn’t have come down to back him up-

TRINI
Hey, Billy, slow down, he didn’t-

BILLY
He didn’t what? Why don’t you go with him, Trini? Oh that’s right, because he hasn’t given you a coin-

TRINI
What’s that supposed to mean?

ZORDON
(quietly)
Can we- can we try to focus, here-

Zack steps forward.

ZACK
I’ll go with you.

Everyone turns. Jason looks slightly relieved.

ZACK
I’ll go with you, but I want a coin. I want to be a Power Ranger.

Jason looks apprehensive, but Alpha 5 bends down, his head opening, revealing the 3 remaining coins in the Morphilus.

Jason stares at Zack.

JASON
Are you sure about this?

ZACK
Am I- he’s telling us they’re going to destroy the world. You guys need to snap out of it.

Everyone looks a little ashamed.

JASON
Okay...But this is serious, this is a big responsib-

ZACK
HEY you ain’t been here, we’ve been dealing with some heavy stuff too: a robot dropped out the ceiling and slapped Billy in the face!

JASON
Okay okay.

Jason picks up a power coin, and hesitantly extends it. Zack takes it, and there’s a spark of pink electricity. Trini’s clearly nervous

TRINI
But- you said we needed the Power Rangers-

ZORDON
As of right now...You are the Power Rangers.

Zordon’s face cycles into energy readings, the tube becoming a massive display, triangulating the teleportation-

Trini and Jason exchange a look as Jason and Zack start to glow- the world flickers once, and then-

EXT. RAIN FOREST - MORNING

Zack and Jason burst into existence twenty feet above the basin of a waterfall, and plummet into the water below. Both of them emerge, spluttering.

ZACK
WHOA! WHOA!

Jason turns over and sees a scorpion crawling on him.

JASON
AHHH!

Zack flicks the scorpion off of him.

JASON
Thanks....It’s morning?

ZACK
Time difference. You got the, uh-

JASON
The coin, right.

Jason takes it out, and presses a glowing pad on it, and a holographic arrow blasts out, pointing through the jungle.

.MOMENTS LATER

Zack and Jason crest the top of a jungle hill, looking out onto the insanely lush and beautiful tropical landscape.

ZACK
I gotta be honest, J. When I woke up this morning I did not think I was gonna get teleported to Asia.

JASON
You think this is weird for you? I’m still technically grounded.

Zack and Jason laugh.

SOMEWHERE, DOWN

IN THE JUNGLE

A group of SMUGGLERS are waking up in the morning. A vicious looking psycho crosses the camp, headed to a tent.

SMUGGLER LEADER
Any luck on the radio?

SMUGGLER RADIOMAN
Nothing. Everything’s silent.

SMUGGLER LEADER
It’s a trick.

A scout comes running up.

SMUGGLER SCOUT
Strangers, in the jungle.

SMUGGLER LEADER
That must be why the communications are down. It’s the military, they must’ve found us. They’re trying to flush us out.

SMUGGLER RADIOMAN
What should we do?

The Smuggler Leader unsheathes a machete.

SMUGGLER LEADER
We find them first.

EXT. ANGEL GROVE - MAINSTREET

The Dominators are all up on their Arcahnastroyer. Smoke is everywhere, many of the buildings around them reduced to rubble; luckily, it looks like all the civilians were smart enough to run.

Kim, not so smart. As some kind of massive, flower-like satellite array unfolds from the top of the vehicle, Kim picks her way through the rubble...

!...Getting closer and closer...She waits until Baboo, peering over the railing, looks away and then runs up the hood of a car and jumps onto a divot on the side of the vehicle, tucking into an alcove, hidden in the undercarriage.

KIM
Nobody messes up my town but me.

The engines start, and Kim is thrown onto her butt, only barely managing to hold on.

INT. THE COMMAND CENTER

Zordon’s tube is faceless, displaying energy read-outs.

Trini and Billy are watching the hologram of the Dominators in uptown Angel Grove in their Arcahnastroyer, having deployed the flower petal-satellite device that appears to be scanning the air.

BILLY
Alpha, what is that?

ALPHA 5
A tracking unit! The Dominators are tracing our energy signature to the place we landed.

TRINI
But...But that was right next to my house. My parents are home, now. The Dominators...I mean they won’t-

ALPHA 5
They’ll destroy everything. The Dominators love to destroy things!

Trini’s eyes widen.

ALPHA 5
(cheerful)
Back to work!

TRINI
Billy. Give me a coin.

BILLY
What?

TRINI
Those things are going to my house, and that’s just their first stop.

BILLY
I can’t just give you a coin, Trini-

Trini advances, intense; she might not have a Pizza Roll, but Trini can still intimidate Billy.

TRINI
Do you want to be the only Power Ranger when the Dominators get here? They are big, weird monsters, Billy.

TRINI
You think you and Alpha 5 are gonna be enough to handle it? I saw one of them punch Jason through a car, and that was Jason, do you really want to be fighting them alone when Grosso Revolto or whatever pops your head like a zit-

BILLY
Alpha, give me the morphilus.

Alpha 5 opens his head, exposing the morphilus. Billy takes out a coin, after a momemnt, meekly hands it to Trini.

There’s a spark of yellow electricity.

TRINI
(sincerely)
...Thank you.
(beat)
I’m- I’m sorry, I’m just scared. You know I’ve always liked...order, and rules, and everything’s...kind of crazy right now.
(beat)
I’m glad you’re here, Billy.

BILLY
Really?
(beat)
I’m not.

ZORDON
Billy.

Both teens startle. Zordon’s voice comes over the intercom.

ZORDON
I think we’ve got enough energy to send the SOS, but I need an authorized ranger coin has to send the message.

Billy nods, and turns, heading down a jeffreys tube. Trini stands alone, looking at the coin in her hand, and then up at the screens showing the Dominators.

EXT. RAIN FOREST

Jason and Zack trek through the thick forest canopy, pushing through the undergrowth.

ZACK
Hey, you remember when we used to hike out back of Billy’s house? Trini would always be scared of snakes, and Kim would always go off on her own and sneak up on us-

JASON
Ah yeah, the good old days, when aliens weren’t trying to destroy the world.
(beat)
Thanks for volunteering, back there. That was cool of you.

ZACK
Yeah, well, no problem man.
(beat)
It’s weird, I feel like I never saw you guys after freshman year. It’s like- you know, as you grow up, everyone kinda separates-

JASON
Yeah well whose fault is that?

Zack gives him a look.

JASON
The second you made football team in freshman year, you stopped talking to me. Billy too, don’t act like you don’t know-

ZACK
You stopped talking to me, too. Getting in fights all the time, acting crazy, you know for a nice guy you can be a real ass sometimes, Jason.

JASON
Whatever, you didn’t need us anymore, you had new friends-

ZACK
Nah, man. The team treats me like crap. I freeze up, under pressure, during games, and them crapping on me for it just makes it worse every time. I haven’t scored a touchdown all season, they don’t even pass me the ball anymore.
(laughs)

ZACK
Dealing with this alien stuff with you guys has been like the most fun I’ve had in two years, and it probably ends with the planet getting blown up, I mean how screwed up is that?

JASON
I mean...very screwed up.

Jason laughs, and Zack smiles sheepishly; Jason’s coin beeps.

JASON
I think we’re getting close.

ZACK
I hope so, man. I think the mosquitos are waking up.

JASON
I think this is it.

They start to tear away the foliage, pushing through into...

INT. RAIN FOREST - THE CAVE - CONTINUOUS

The cave is a massive hollow space, filled with stalactites and stalagmites, moss and vines hanging everywhere, a few streams of light streaking down, onto...

JASON
Look at the teeth on this guy.

ZACK
Is that what I think it is?

JASON
Yeah man. That’s a T-Rex.

Zack and Jason stare down at the massive, derelict hulk of the TYRANNOSAURUS ZORD.

There’s the rumble of a car engine behind them; they look out to see a dozen of the smugglers unloading from a humvee.

JASON
Oh COME ON-

Zack grabs him, pulling him down into the cave.

ZACK
DO NOT YELL AT STRANGERS WITH GUNS!

INT. THE COMMAND CENTER - INNER-CHAMBER

It’s an extremely claustrophobic system of computer displays and machinery; clearly not meant for human interaction. We’re under the Command Center, it’s all cramped tunnels down here.

Zordon’s face glows on a screen behind Billy, as he holds out his coin to a machine.

ZORDON
Okay, get ready. The system is going to scan you.

Laser scanners trace all over Billy; he flinches, it clearly feels really weird. Everything suddenly glows blue around Billy, the old technology humming to life.

BILLY
What’s it doing?

ZORDON
It’s reading your psionic energy; testing you. Not anyone can be a Power Ranger. The armors aren't just steel and circuits; they're extensions of your life force, your personality. That’s why every suit is different. Rangers teams work and train their minds for decades to sync up with each other enough to form the Megazord.
(beat)
My team was like my family.

As the machines powering up, Billy presses a little further.

BILLY
What happened to them? How’d you end up stuck here for so long?

Zordon’s quiet for a moment.

ZORDON
Rita betrayed us.

BILLY
Wait- Rita Repulsa was a Power Ranger?

ZORDON
(sadly)
Was, yes. We’d been assigned to your sector, to track down the Dominators.

ZORDON
But when we got here Repulsa turned on me and my team. She’d been seduced by Lord Zedd’s promises of power and glory. Of a universe without rules, where only the strong survive. By the time I was able to defeat her, freeze the Dominators and crash their ship on the dark side of your moon, it was too late...I’d lost everything.
(beat)
I suppose this was all just a matter of time. You kids are my one chance to stop her; to save your world and set things right.

The machines begin vibrating and humming, lighting up.

ZORDON
Well I’ll be damned. This old bucket’s still got some juice. We’ll be able to send a message as soon as it finishes loading.

BILLY
And that’ll be it? They’ll come and get the Dominators and-

ALPHA 5 (ON COMM)
Zordon! Our friend left!

BILLY
Oh no.

SLAM TO:

EXT. THE PASTEL CANYON DIG - MOMENTS LATER

Trini, behind the wheel of her almost totally destroyed car, turns the key in the ignition, peeling out in the mud and rain as Billy and Alpha 5 run out of the entrance to the Command Center.

Billy yells in frustration, the rain pouring down on him.

BILLY
This is bad, this is bad bad bad-

ALPHA 5
She said she wanted to visit her family, with the Dominators!

BILLY
The Dominators are going to Trini’s parents’ house?

ZORDON (ON COMM)
It’s where I landed, they’re looking for me. Good god, if she tries to confront them she’ll be killed. You gave her a coin?

BILLY
I- I was trying to help! Can’t you just teleport her back here or-

ZORDON
If we use the teleporters now we’ll give away our position...But if we don’t stop her, we lose the coin-

BILLY
The coin? That’s what you’re worried about?

ZORDON
(frustrated)
Bring her back. But whatever you do, don’t try to fight them.

Billy nods, but stands perfectly still, breathing hard.

ZORDON
Go. Now!

INT. THE KWAN HOUSE - KITCHEN

MICHAEL KWAN, 40s, and ELLEN KWAN, 40s, are in their kitchen, clearly panicked, going back and forth quickly.

MICHAEL KWAN
How long are we supposed to wait for her?

ELLEN KWAN
Staying here is safer-

MICHAEL KWAN
And leaving her out there is crazy, we have to look for her, she can’t have gone far-

ELLEN KWAN
Look where? You heard the explosions in the city, we can’t go out there-

MICHAEL KWAN
No, you’re right- I just- I’m trying to be smart about this, I-

Everything in the room starts rattling. Windows shatter in their frames; rain and wind blow in from outside.

The Kwans scream, ducking down, and Michael grabs Ellen, pulling her away out to

EXT. THE KWAN HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Trini’s parents run out into the rainy night. Michael looks up; in the distance, he can see fires burning in Angel Grove.

Ellen numbly tugs his sleeve; he turns to see the ARMORED HOVERCRAFT looming over the old barn across the street.

Michael pulls her back, protectively.

MICHAEL KWAN
Oh my god.

All of the spooky alien lights on the hovercraft suddenly TURN, FOCUSING IN ON THE KWANS. Two putties drop down from nowhere behind them!

Ellen yanks Michael away, only for Scorpina to POP INTO THE LIGHT NEXT TO THEM! The Kwans yell in fear and run STRAIGHT INTO GOLDAR.

INT. RAIN FOREST - THE CAVE

Jason and Zack have reached the side of the downed Tyrannosaurus Zord, and Jason is carefully picking his way up the vines on the side of it, climbing it like a jungle gym.

Zack is at the bottom, nervously trying to get a foothold.

We can hear the smugglers yelling up near the entrance; their flashlights play on the massive body of the Zord.

Jason takes out his coin, which projects a hologram of the Zord and all sorts of readings and glyphs.

JASON
There must be some kind of access to the inside somewhere. My coin is going crazy-

ZACK
Jason, these dudes do not look happy about the giant robot and they seem to be super in to the idea of just shooting everything-

The smugglers see Jason climbing, and yell, taking some potshots at him.

JASON
Oh crap!

ZACK
You climb!
(takes out his coin)
I got this.

>FURTHER UP IN

>THE CAVE

The smugglers slowly proceed forward, flashlights scanning the darkness.

SMUGGLER LEADER
Slowly...slowly...

Something BURSTS OUT OF THE DARKNESS, tackling him and SLAMMING him to the ground!

Zack, in his Ranger armor, is MORE than a match for the smugglers; the reflexes and athleticism that make him a great running back are enhanced ten-fold, and bullets bounce off him harmlessly.

The smugglers, viciously beaten, turn tail and run.

The Pink Ranger stands tall. Wait, what? Zack registers the armor as being pink, and turns back to yell to Jason.

ZACK
YO WHY’D YOU GIVE ME THE PINK ONE?

JASON
I didn’t know, the coins don’t show their color-

ZACK
You and me are gonna have a talk about this one, man!

Over on the T-Rex Zord, an access panel slides open.

EXT. THE KWAN HOUSE - NIGHT

The Arcahnastroyer is landed nearby, and Squatt and Baboo are out front of the house with some putties. Inside, we can hear scary electrical sounds.

Baboo notices Trini’s car’s one working headlight is zipping up the road towards them, and squawks, alerting Squatt.

Squatt laughs, and Baboo squawks again, grinning.

Baboo takes aim with his energy cannon, and FIRES! The blast UTTERLY DESTROYS Trini’s car, leaving only smoking wreckage.

The two alien idiots laugh, and then there’s the sound of wrenching metal from the wreckage. Both of them falter, confused.

The wreckage explodes apart- standing in the rain, lit by the fire from the blast, is the Yellow Ranger. Trini’s dazed, but sees Squatt and Baboo at her house and begins SPRINTING TOWARDS THEM.

Trini’s speed and focus as a runner is clearly the target of the suit’s amplifying abilities: she’s doing 70 mph.

Squatt fumbles frantically with his still recharging laser blaster as Baboo squawks in panic, drawing his own plasma-pistol- too late-

Trini DROPKICKS BABOO TWENTY FEET BACKWARDS OFF THE ROAD, decapitates two putties, and then grabs Squatt and FLINGS HIM THROUGH HER GARAGE DOOR- CRASH.

INT. THE KWAN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Trini’s parents hang suspended in clouds of red electricity, the only light in the room. There’s a crash from outside, and both of them drop to the ground.

REPULSA (O.S.)
Whatever that was. End it.

Goldar nods, and Scorpina hisses and moves off-screen.

INT. THE KWAN HOUSE - FOYER - CONTINUOUS

The door is SMASHED OFF THE HINGES by the Yellow Ranger.

Trini, breathing hard inside the suit, slowly advances into her darkened home...

She sees her parents in the living room, laying nearly unconscious, and starts to go to them when-

SCORPINA DROPS FROM THE CEILING AND ATTACKS! Her first blow sends Trini SMASHING into a wall of family photos; Trini briefly finds herself face to face with her own baby picture before Scorpina ATTACKS AGAIN-

EXT. UP THE ROAD FROM THE KWAN HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Billy pulls up to the wreckage of Trini’s car.

BILLY
Oh no...Trini...

A putty RIPS off the door of his car, and FLINGS HIM OUT.

Billy pushes himself up, to see 7 putties. He’s surrounded.

>THE

>ARCAHNASTROYER

Kim, hiding in the Hover-Vehicle, sees Billy surrounded.

KIM
Billy...what’re you doing here, man-

There’s a FLASH OF BLUE LIGHT, and Kim jerks back as we hear the putties attack.

>IN THE HOUSE

Scorpina is beating on Trini in a similar manner to the way Goldar kicked the crap out of Jason; her armor’s already damaged, and they’re destroying everything until-

Trini is able to briefly use her speed and knowledge of the house to get ahead of Scorpina- she grabs her Track Trophy and when the monster catches up- CRASH!

Scorpina screeches and Trini moves to protect her parents-

Billy comes crashing down through the ceiling, blue armor covered in putty slime!

BILLY
Trini we have to get out of here-

.SCORPINA ATTACKS!

Billy’s analytical mind and defensive nature means that his suit’s enhancements take the form of awesome gadgets and defense mechanisms, it’s dazzling to witness.

The two rangers together are able to briefly back Scorpina down when- RED ELECTRICITY BLOWS OUT OF THE DARKNESS!

>OUTSIDE

Kim carefully picks her way through the gooped putties outside, quickly sneaking past Baboo, who’s still dazed.

She adjusts her cop belt, and gets up on to the porch to look

>INSIDE

Where she sees Billy and Trini, their armor malfunctioning badly, laying on the ground next to Trini’s parents. Another wave of RED ELECTRICITY blasts them-

It becomes clear that when this happens, it’s not electricity being shot in, it’s actually electricity being sucked out.

Kim gasps as...

RITA REPULSA lurches out of the darkness, looming over Billy and Trini.

Repulsa is massive; think the Queen Alien from James Cameron’s Aliens, Maleficent from Sleeping Beauty and the creature from Species as one ultimate combination of deadly, horribly alien matriarchal evil.

Squatt and Baboo shuffle in from outside, embarrassed.

REPULSA
Children...they’re CHILDREN.

GOLDAR
Zordon recruited human children...Why?

Rita blasts them again, leeching life-force out of them; it’s clearly incredibly painful, and both Rangers writhe in agony.

REPULSA
Can’t you smell the stink? These are this one’s parents. They’re not REAL Power Rangers, they’re just babies, playing with toys they can’t possibly understand.

GOLDAR
The Red Ranger had Zordon’s coin-

REPULSA
Don’t you see? The Eltarians never arrived. Now he’s outnumbered, outsmarted, overwhelmed...

REPULSA
(cackles)
Back on Eltar I was a big fish in a small pond, but on Earth? I’m a whale in a teardrop. They don’t stand a chance.

BILLY
(pained)
You’re wrong.

REPULSA
What? Am I? I’ll find the Command Center, I’ll get my scepter back, drain Zordon dry and then your planet’s core will fuel the ship’s engines. Your world’s destruction will be nothing more than a footnote in the glorious story of my return to Zedd’s empire!

BILLY
The Eltarians- the Eltarians are on their way here now. Zordon was just the first to arrive, he said he wanted to arrest you personally.

Rita, but then she throws back her head and laughs.

REPULSA
Did you know, Blue Ranger, that my kind feeds on psionic energy...the crackling of electricity between brain cells...

She bends down and wrenches Billy up, wrapping her talons around his neck, smiling with rows of terrifying teeth.

REPULSA
...When I feed, I can see glimpses of thought, sense emotions. That pain you feel is your very essence leaving your body, so your lies are wasted on me.

Repulsa licks Billy with a creepy forked tongue.

REPULSA
I can savor your friend’s helplessness and panic at losing control...and you, Blue Ranger...I can taste your fear and cowardice.

KIM (O.S.)
Eat this.

Repulsa is STRUCK IN THE TONGUE WITH A TAZER DART! Repulsa SHRIEKS, staggering back as her head is ELECTROCUTED!

Kim is IN THE ROOM- Goldar ROARS and ADVANCES- She sprays him in the face with MACE- Baboo, making a grab for her, gets the same- Squatt lurches forward- gets a baton THROWN IN HIS FACE-

Scorpina hisses and advances- Kim reaches in her jacket pocket, drawing brass knuckles- Okay Kim, we get that you’re bad-ass and that was pretty cool, but do you really think you’re going to FIST FIGHT an alien?

REPULSA
Adorable.

Repulsa, recovered, grabs Kim by the collar, lifting her like a harmless kitten as she screams and swings at Rita wildly.

TRINI
Kim!?

BILLY^
Kim!?

REPULSA
This is the best defense Earth has to offer?

KIM
Are you kidding, I just kicked all your asses-

REPULSA
Beg for your life!

KIM
Make me.

Kim punches Repulsa in the face, hurting her own hand, but the act of defiance is enough to set Rita off.

REPULSA
RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!

Repulsa draws back a claw, starting to pull life-force out of Kim but-

.KIM IS TELEPORTED OUT OF HER HANDS IN A BURST OF LIGHT!

Repulsa spins to Billy, Trini and her parents- FLASH FLASH FLASH FLASH!

They’re gone. The Dominators stare in shock. Goldar groans in rage, and Scorpina hisses.

GOLDAR
Teleporters! They must have access to the Command Center....But how could they do that, human children couldn’t operate the mothership!

REPULSA
Not the children.
(hisses the name)
Zordon.

INT. THE COMMAND CENTER - SHORTLY THEREAFTER

Trini, dazed, shakes herself awake to see her parents slowly standing up in the Command Center.

ELLEN KWAN
TRINI. WHAT THE HELL IS GOING-

Both parents are ZAPPED INTO UNCONSCIOUSNESS by Alpha 5.

TRINI
OH MY GOD! You killed them!

ALPHA 5
They’re fantastic! Only sleeping.

Trini rushes to check on her parents. Billy, pained, slowly starts to push himself up, his armor deactivating. He sees Kim looking around in wonder at the Command Center.

KIM
Are...are we still on Earth?

ALPHA 5
(unhelpfully)
YOU’RE UNNNNNDER IT!

Alpha goes to zap Kim.

KIM
NOT. HAPPENING.

ALPHA 5
(sulks)
Okay.

BILLY
I can’t believe you did that.

KIM
What?

BILLY
Attacked them like that. The aliens.

KIM
Someone has to save your ass.

BILLY
Yeah, but why is it always you?

KIM
Why, because I’m the girl your mom warned you about?

BILLY
No, my mom doesn’t have nearly enough imagination.

There’s a beat, in which Kim tries to hide a blushing smile.

BILLY
Zordon, I’m sorry we fought them, I-

Zordon’s face comes up on a screen behind Kim, startling her.

His tone is grim and frustrated.

ZORDON
Too late for apologies now. The SOS is almost ready, but we don’t have much time. We had to teleport you out to save you; it was too close, they’ll be able to trace our energy signature. The Dominators are on their way.

Kim looks to Trini, who’s checking on her parents with Alpha 5, then back at Billy.

KIM
I always knew Trini was secretly a total headcase but...
(beat)
Billy...dude...Be real with me right now: Are you a super hero?

BILLY
It’s kind of a long story-

KIM
Go for it.

BILLY
Well, it starts with this bad alien called Rita Repulsa-

KIM
“Rita Repulsa?”

BILLY
I know.

INT. T-REX ZORD

They’re in the cockpit of the T-Rex Zord, ancient, musty, more Indiana Jones than Star Wars.

Jason is trying to get his coin to fit in to a number of different receptacles on the control panel; it’s not working, and he looks ridiculous.

ZACK
Are you just trying to shove it in random things or-

JASON
No it’s gotta be- you know, one of these, right? We power it up and it teleports itself back to the Command Center...

Something on the console gives Jason an electric shock.

JASON
Ack! Stupid robot!

ZACK
You look like a baby playing with a computer right now, this is not inspiring confidence-

JASON
Hey, Zack? I’m sorry.

ZACK
What?

JASON
I mean, you’re right, about- I don’t know, when we were kids, I sort of thought of you and me and Billy as a team. Like it was us against the world, and then- Billy started doing like really good in school, and you started getting good at sports...I don’t know. I’ve been acting like a total dick for six years. And I’m sorry. Zack’s quiet for a beat.

ZACK
Maybe you’re the problem.

JASON
What? I just said I-

ZACK
No, I mean, try morphing. Maybe it needs you AND the coin.

Jason shakes off the misunderstanding, and raises his coin.

.OUTSIDE

The cave is lit by a burst of red light from the T-Rex’s cockpit, and suddenly lights begin glowing all over the ancient robot’s structure!

>INSIDE

Jason’s Red Ranger armor is rapidly interfacing with the activated control panel; a cockpit seat pops up from the floor perfectly suited to Jason’s body, as wires and controls burst out, connecting directly to the helmet, arms and hands of the suit.

.JASON’S POV

Jason is suddenly flooded with visual information, bright lights; it’s clear that operating a Zord is taxing, as Zordon said it would be. Jason groans in pain.

ZACK
You okay?

JASON
I...Yeah. I got this.

EXT. RAIN FOREST - THE CAVE - CONTINUOUS

As the cave rumbles and shakes, the smugglers run in fear, back towards their humvees. The leader turns around just in time to see:

The top half of the T-Rex Zord ERUPTS through the roof of the cave, and ROARS at the midday sun, causing a choir of animals to scream up from the jungle, hundreds of birds taking off all around.

Whoa. That’s in the trailer.

JASON
WHOOO HAHAHA YEAH!

Jason pilots the T-Rex, SMASHING THE REST OF THE CAVE APART!

The smugglers, in their jeep, look back at the rampaging dinosaur robot, yelling in terror, and then-

It falls down, crashing through the trees. The smugglers look at each other, confused.

SMUGGLER SCOUT
...It fell down?

>IN THE REX

ZACK
Maybe take it easy-

JASON
...Yeah.

ZACK
-just focus on trying to teleport back-

JASON
Yeah, yes.

>OUTSIDE

The T-Rex GETS BACK UP, and the smugglers scream in fear again, slamming on the gas!

EXT. THE PASTEL CANYON DIG

The night is lit up by the spectral, menacing glow of the hover-tank as it rattles up the mountain road towards the Pastel Canyon dig.

As it approaches, it begins dropping dozens upon dozens of putties in every direction, which plop down to the mud in the rainy night.

In the distance, we can see the red spire of energy reaching up into the sky from the ocean. The bad guys are here.

Repulsa stands out on the deck, lit by lightning, looking terrifying as the Dominators prepare for battle.

REPULSA
Smash your way in! Get me my scepter: Kill the humans, and capture Zordon alive.

INT. THE COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS

The holo-displays all over the Command Center show the arrival of the Dominators; more and more putties drop off the Arcahnastroyer as it lowers over the entrance to the Command Center.

The teens are clearly panicked.

KIM
What are you waiting for, if you’re gonna call for help call for help, dial 9-1-Alien or whatever-

ZORDON
We’re still a couple minutes away; I’m trying to reroute power to the defenses-

The Arcahnastroyer opens fire on the gate to the Command Center, a barrage of different powerful energy weapons ERUPTING from cannons, blowing away the thousands of years of rock around the massive buried UFO in seconds!

Everything in the Command Center shakes violently.

TRINI
Get my parents out of here!

ALPHA 5
And put them where?

TRINI
I don’t care, just do it now!

Alpha activates something on a console, and Trini’s unconscious parents vanish in bursts of light.

BILLY
Guys...Shouldn’t we get out of here, or-

TRINI
We can’t leave until Zordon’s sent the message. Alpha, give me the morphilus.

Alpha opens the morphilus, and Trini goes to it, reaching in and drawing out the final Power Coin.

TRINI
Kim, take this.

Trini hands Kim the final power coin. There’s a crackle of purpley-black electricity; the Command Center shakes again.

ALPHA 5
Entry way is compromised! Here come the bad guys!

Kim stares at the coin in her hand.

KIM
Why me? You’ve hated me since first grade-

TRINI
You saved my life, and my parents. You do things other people are afraid to. You hit harder than I do, and someone who hits hard is what we need right now.

KIM
I don’t know, I’m not really a team player-

TRINI
Maybe you just never had the right team.

KIM
I can get into that.

Billy’s at Zordon’s holotube.

BILLY
What do we do? How do we stop them?

ZORDON
Block off the ramp, I’ll try to get the exterior cannon online-

There’s an EXPLOSION and the big gate to the Commander Center bursts open; putties begin to flood in, rushing onto the catwalk, Goldar walking amongst them.

KIM
Fake punks go home.

Kim takes a running start towards the putties as Billy and Trini morph. Just as Kim reaches them, she morphs into The Black Ranger!

Kim’s natural toughness and brawling style is the focus of her armor’s amplification; it’s got retractable spikes and clubs all over, and the gloves have built-in brass knuckles.

Her collision with the putties can be equated to a strike in bowling: WHAM.

BILLY
Okay. Whoa.

TRINI
YOU WRECKED MY HOUSE!

Trini CHARGES IN TO HELP KIM! Goldar laughs as he advances on our two chicks.

GOLDAR
YES! YES! FIGHT ME, HUMANS!

Putties begin crawling up the sides of the Command Center’s hub, swarming in like ants, surrounding Billy and Alpha 5.

ZORDON
Don’t let them get the scepter!

Billy, clearly terrified, morphs, standing over the scepter as he begins battling putties!

EXT. THE PASTEL CANYON DIG - CONTINUOUS

Squatt and Baboo are out on the bow of the Arcahnastroyer, piloting, continuing the assault on the outside of the Command Center.

As more dirt is blown away, we can see more and more of the shape of the starship itself. Squatt and Baboo laugh, revelling in the destruction, when-

In a massive flash of red light, THE T-REX ZORD TELEPORTS IN.

The laughter abruptly stops.

SQUATT
Uh oh.

>IN THE REX

Jason and Zack, in the cockpit, look down at the chaos.

ZACK
We’re too late!

JASON
Fat chance.

The T-Rex Zord charges forward, stomping the flow of putties into the Command Center! It lurches low, swinging its tail at the Arcahnastroyer, which only barely manages to evade.

>COMMAND CENTER

Trini and Kim are both fighting Goldar, as well as being mobbed by putties; it’s way too much, they can’t last long.

GOLDAR
You can do it, humans! Try harder!

In the Command Center hub, Billy, is momentarily distracted by the T-Rex Zord coming up on the screens- SCORPINA ATTACKS FROM BEHIND, flooring him, and grabs the scepter!

ZORDON
Jason, do not push the attack! Retreat and initiate Zord recall, it’s the only way to hold her off!

>OUTSIDE

JASON
No way! We’ve got them on the run, I can end this right now!

Jason’s clearly in pain from operating the Zord, but pushes the attack, the Arcahnastroyer frantically retreating.

REPULSA
MY SCEPTER! NOW!

>INSIDE

Scorpina tosses the Scepter to a putty, and then it is rapidly passed hot-potato style up the catwalk all the way to Goldar, who turns and throws it-

>OUTSIDE

All the way to Rita, who catches it on the bow of her ship as the T-Rex Zord cuts them off again-

ZORDON
JASON RETREAT NOW, RETREAT NOW-

Repulsa, dwarfed by the T-Rex Zord, raises her scepter, and it’s immediately evident why this is bad:

.SHE FIRES OUT A HUGE BLAST OF RED ELECTRICITY THAT BLOWS THE 150 TON ZORD CLEAN OFF ITS FEET.

ZORDON
No, no!

The blast nearly decapitates the Zord, blowing Zack out of the cockpit! He’s able to morph in mid air, but then CRASHES through trees into the dirt!

The impact with the ground rips Jason free of all of the interfaces; it’s sudden and violent, looks painful.

>INSIDE

Trini sees the Zord fall.

TRINI
Jason!

She breaks free of the putties, and takes off sprinting towards the Red Zord, leaving Kim in a one on one against fifty putties and Goldar.

ZORDON
Billy, The SOS is ready, I’m sending it now. Get out of here.

BILLY
What? No!

ZORDON
If you stay here you’ll die. The Rangers will come to protect your planet, but I have to stay here to finish the transmission.

Billy clearly is hesitating.

ZORDON
RUN! NOW!

All of the lights in the command center go neon-green, and a blast shield closes around Zordon’s holotube!

Billy turns, dodging a tail-sting from Scorpina; Alpha 5 attacks her, knocking her backwards.

Billy looks up to see Kim fighting on the walkway, outnumbered completely. He mans the central control panel, and talks to Kim through their suits.

BILLY
Kim, I’m teleporting you out, we have to run!

KIM
What? What about you?

BILLY
It’s- It’s hard to explain, things are happening too fast-

Kim knocks away Goldar, and faces down with putties.

KIM
Do you realize how weird my day has been, Billy!? I can handle it.

Billy steels himself.

BILLY
I can’t leave Zordon here alone, they’ll kill him.

KIM
Then back off, I’ve never run away from a fight and I’m not starting now!

Kim is SMASHED DOWN BY GOLDAR, and mobbed by putties!

>OUTSIDE

Jason, badly messed up, is crawling out of the Red Zord’s cockpit, as Baboo aims at him with a Sniper rifle of some kind from the deck of the Arcahnastroyer.

He squawks, pulls the trigger, but there’s a yellow flash and the Red Ranger is gone-

Squatt spots Trini pulling Jason away at high-speed and opens fire with his Blaster Cannon, blowing huge holes in the ground around her as she flees and then- BOOM!

One hits right next to her, and the concussive blast sends them both down the slope of the canyon, violently rolling hundreds of feet into the ravine below, OUCH.

>INSIDE

Rita’s Arcahnastroyer is landing- Kim’s still swinging, but IT’S GOLDAR ON ONE SIDE, SCORPINA ON THE OTHER, and the rest of Dominators coming in from outside!

BILLY
I’m sorry Kim-

KIM
Billy don’t you dare-

Kim turns just in time to turn face to face with Repulsa, WHO RAISES THE SCEPTER STARTING TO BLAST KIM, THROWING HER BACKWARDS-

BILLY
No.

Kim is teleported out-

EXT. PASTEL HILLS - ROAD - CONTINUOUS

Kim teleports in on a hillside road, crashing to the ground, her suit deactivating, still crackling with Rita’s evil energy-

But she dropped to the ground right in front of an oncoming military jeep, which swerves, brakes screeching in the rain.

INT. THE COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS

Scorpina SMASHES DOWN ALPHA 5, BEHEADING HIM- but this give Billy the distraction he needs to dive down into one of the hatches to beneath the Command Center, the cramped space where he talked to Zordon earlier.

Scorpina looks around, confused, and then looks down into

INT. THE COMMAND CENTER - INNER CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

As Scorpina looks in, Billy presses himself against the wall-his suit camouflages, rendering him invisible. Scorpina, not the brightest bulb, hisses, her face inches from Billy’s...

!...and then pulls away.

INT. THE COMMAND CENTER - INNER CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

Repulsa and the Dominators walk triumphantly up the catwalk to the Command Center. Repulsa steps into the hub, allowing herself a moment of absolute victory, laughing.

She taps the big central holotube.

REPULSA
Zordon? Are you in there? I thought you should know: You’ve lost.

Goldar and Scorpina peel away the blast shields surrounding Zordon’s tube, as Rita watches, Billy silently listening from beneath them.

The face flickers to life.

REPULSA
Hello again, old friend. So nice to see you stuck around waiting for me...or was it that The Eltarians never came to save you?

ZORDON
Lord Zedd never came for you, either, Rita.

The Dominators all exchange loaded looks. Ouch.

REPULSA
The great and noble Zordon, reduced to a human face on a projection tube, leader of a child army of rodents that runs at the first sign of trouble-

ZORDON
...Runs? The humans are alive?
(legit amused)
Wait...ha..you mean to tell me you didn't even get one of them?

REPULSA
They'll die with their world. They pose no threat to me.

ZORDON
And yet in a confrontation where you had every advantage you managed to kill exactly NONE of them.
(beat)
There’s still time, Rita.

REPULSA
Time? For what?

ZORDON
For you to surrender. I’ve sent a message back to Eltar.

ZORDON
They’ll be here soon, and all this will be over.

Repulsa bursts into a fit of horrible laughter, Squatt and Baboo joining her.

RITA
You really think I'd risk coming down to Earth for this ship if there was any chance of real Power Rangers coming to stop me? We scanned the galaxy weeks before we landed.
(laughs, gleeful)
The Eltarian Empire has fallen. The last Power Ranger died fifteen thousand years ago. Lord Zedd rules the universe.

Zordon is in shock; the weight of this revelation is staggering. Billy’s wide-eyed in horror.

REPULSA
(smiles)
There is no help coming, Zordon. And you will die as you've lived for twenty thousand years: ALONE.

Rita raises her scepter and blasts the Holotube with arcs of red electricity, then stabs the scepter into an outlet module at the center of the room.

Zordon screams in pain, his image flickering in the holotube as electricity blasts back and forth.

REPULSA
(to Squatt and Baboo)
We’ll drain his lifeforce to get the core-leech started. It’s only a matter of time.

EXT. PASTEL CANYON - HILLSIDE UNDERBRUSH

Trini, in a confused daze, her ears still ringing, helps Jason through the muddy underbrush as rain pours down.

EXT. PASTEL CANYON - TUNNEL

A hillside road runs through a small tunnel in the mountain, lit by flickering orangey fluorescents.

Trini and Jason are both still reeling from the fight: cut, bruised, and disoriented. They limp into the tunnel.

Jason staggers and falls, and Trini goes to help him, laying him up against the wall of the tunnel.

TRINI
Jason? Can you hear me?

JASON
Yeah I just- the zords, it’s like a lot of noise in your head...maybe Zordon was right, maybe we’re not supposed to use them...
(wakes up a bit)
How did the Dominators find the Command Center?

TRINI
...It was my fault. Billy gave me a coin, I was trying to save my parents-

JASON
None of this is your fault. You had the right idea when it started, I’m the one who hit the alien with a frying pan. And then the- I had them, I thought I could just end it, you know?
(beat)
I thought if I could stop them myself, when the other Eltarians arrived they’d- I don’t know-

Jason looks into rain. Trini puts her hand on his, and then Zack peeks into the tunnel, startling them both.

ZACK
Sorry, it’s me, it’s me.

Trini rushes up to him and hugs him tightly.

TRINI
I thought you were dead.

ZACK
Hey, at least you ran out to get Jason. All I did was fall in a bush. I froze up, I- By the time I got it together there were those grey things everywhere and the Zord was down.

ZACK
(beat)
Where’s Billy?

Jason looks up, also curious.

TRINI
I- I don’t know, he was in the Command Center with Kim-

ZACK
Whoa slow down, Kim Hart?

TRINI
They got inside- I- I had to try to get...Jason...

Everyone’s quiet, realizing their friends might be dead.

Jason punches the wall in frustration.

ZACK
Is this it?
(beat)
I mean...What do we do n-

The Rangers are hit with a huge spotlight; all three of them flinch, startled.

EXT. PARKING LOT ON THE EDGE OF TOWN - SUNRISE

A military humvee is parked in a grocery store parking lot.

Fires burn in the near distance from the Dominators’ rampage.

A soldier with an M-16 stands nearby in the rain; the first lights of dawn are hitting Angel Grove through the storm.

Kim stirs awake from unconsciousness in the back of the humvee, to her power coin giving off a distinctive tone.

BILLY (ON COIN)
Kim? Kim can you hear me?

KIM
Billy?

INT. THE COMMAND CENTER - INNER CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

Billy is down in the chambers, invisible and hidden in a nook, operating screens clandestinely with his coin.

We intercut between them as Billy hurriedly whispers.

BILLY
Where are you?

KIM
I’m- I’m in some kind of jeep, it looks like soldiers found me-

BILLY
Yeah, they’re evacuating the whole city, I can see it from here. I’m hidden in the Command Center- my suit went invisible- I don’t know how long I can do it before they notice me-

KIM
Where is everybody?

BILLY
I don’t know, I’m still figuring this thing out, you’re the only one I’ve contacted so far-

KIM
Billy, get out of there.

BILLY
I can’t. It doesn’t matter now anyway.

KIM
Doesn’t- I thought the big tube guy was gonna calling the good aliens-

BILLY
The message didn’t matter- the Power Rangers all died a long time ago- they’re killing Zordon and using his energy to charge up that thing that’s going to end the world. It’s over, we lost.

Kim reacts to this, thinking, processing. She tries the doors; they’re locked from the outside. She sighs, slumping in her seat.

KIM
(beat)
So does that mean we’re never gonna make out?

BILLY
...what?

KIM
That was why I came back to town in the first place. I missed you guys. I missed you. I’ve been hanging out with people I don’t like for too long. I thought getting on a superhero team with you was like, sure thing, but now I guess the world’s gonna blow up, so-

BILLY
...wait are you saying you want to make out with me?

A big military truck rumbles into the lot, and Kim’s coin suddenly displays Pink, Red and Yellow arrows.

KIM
...No way.

BILLY
What? What’s happening?

KIM
Hang on, Bill. I’m gonna do something stupid.

>OUTSIDE

Several National Guard troops disembark from the front of the truck, and the two guys guarding the Humvee come out to meet them.

One of Kim’s guys is a SERGEANT, and he addresses the PRIVATE from the bigger truck.

SERGEANT
Where the hell have you been? Satellites are all still down, and till we get communications back online we have to be on time to the checkpoints if we’re gonna keep the evacuation coordinated-

PRIVATE
Yes sir, sorry sir, we found more civilian stragglers on recon patrol. Two looters at a gas station in town, and then some up by Pastel Canyon, teenagers talking about an alien invasion-

SERGEANT
Alien invas- Did you document them?

PRIVATE
No sir not yet sir, we were in a hurry to get out of there.

SERGEANT
What? Why’s that?

PRIVATE
...We heard noises, sir. Loud, loud noises.

>AT THE TRUCK

Zack, Trini and Jason sit in the canopied back, looking low.

Bulk and Skull are behind them, talking incessantly.

SKULL
That’s what I’m saying man, it’s clearly a conspiracy. The government doesn’t tell us anything. For all we know they’re the ones doing this. DTA, don’t trust anybody, right?

BULK
Yeah. Hey Jason, your dad’s a cop, don’t act like you don’t know what’s going on.

Jason just looks at Zack, then Trini.

SKULL
Jason. Hey idiot, we’re talking to you.

Jason tenses, clearly ready to attack...Both Trini and Zack tense up...

Jason stops himself, and shakes his head.

JASON
You know what Skull? I think you’ve got it all figured out.

SKULL
I knew it! I knew it had to- AHH!

Kim suddenly climbs up into back of the truck, breathless and soaking wet, startling everyone. Bulk and Skull exchange a look.

BULK
Kim? What-

KIM
All the other Power Rangers are dead. There was no one to get Zordon’s message. Billy’s trapped in the Command Center, and any minute now they’re going to activate the engine and blow up the planet.

The Rangers exchange a hard look.

SKULL
...Uh....

>BACK OUTSIDE.

SERGEANT
I’m sorry private, did you just say “roaring and explosions-”

PRIVATE
Yes sir, there were lights as well-

There’s suddenly a loud CRASH from behind them, from behind them at the truck, and Bulk and Skull go running out.

SKULL
They’re aliens, man, they’re aliens!

As Bulk and Skull run off into the rain, the military advances on the truck, guns raised. They slowly make their way around it...

To see that the far side of the truck is completely ripped open, and the teenagers are gone.

A grunt over at the humvee checks for Kim, and the far door drops off, clattering loudly to the ground.

GRUNT
...Somethin’ ripped the door off...

The Sergeant looks around, completely flummoxed. The Private steps forward, hesitant.

PRIVATE
Sir, d- did we just witness an abduction?

INT. THE COMMAND CENTER - INNER CHAMBER

Billy is hidden, still camouflaged, but has to move when Baboo suddenly comes down next to him, followed by Squatt.

As they burp and squawk back and forth, turning on various machines. Billy is forced to slowwwwly, carefully maneuver between them.

He turns, and squeaks into another nook, but it’s clear the ship is entering final start-up preparations.

JASON (ON COIN)
Billy?

BILLY
Jason?

INT. ANGEL GROVE HIGH - GYM

The Rangers are gathered in the abandoned gym, wet from the rain, pre-dawn light coming in from outside. Jason’s holding his coin.

JASON
Can you get access to the teleporters?

BILLY (ON COIN)
Yeah, but I can’t use them. The second I activate it they’ll be able to trace it-

JASON
That’s okay, we’re coming to you.

BILLY
What?

Jason looks to the Rangers around him. Everyone’s hesitant, listening.

JASON
(beat)
What’ve we got to lose, that we die twenty minutes before everyone else on the planet?

The Rangers gather around.

JASON
I’m not gonna stand here, waiting for the world to end.

JASON
You wanna lose to them? Really, they’re the ones who take out earth?

The Rangers yell out responses. Consensus: Dominators suck.

JASON
I am not going to let our planet be destroyed by a bitch, a blue baboon, a bug and two rejects from the Muppet Show.

ZACK
I heard that, I want round two.

KIM
My cell phone hasn’t worked in over 24 hours, and I am PISSED OFF.

JASON
There are five of us now; five coins, five zords. Zordon said that was a full team.
(beat)
Yes, maybe we’re disorganized, easy example: Kim Hart is here, she has a power coin, I have no idea when or how that happened, but I’m cool with it. Cause the hard fact is we aren’t helpless. Maybe we’re just stupid humans. Maybe we’re just teenagers.
(beat)
But we have access to some very, very large robots. And we are going to work together to do-
(beat)
SOMETHING!

All of the teens agree loudly, excited. In the COMMAND CENTER, Billy facepalms.

KIM
Something! YES!

ZACK
Savin’ the world!

Billy laughs reluctantly to himself. His friends are insane.

The Rangers go back and forth, fast and furious.

ZACK
They think we’re idiots, right? We can use that. I mean they’re not even looking for us, man, and Billy’s in the Command Center-

TRINI
If we distract them long enough to get to your T-Rex, we can trigger the recall, bring in the rest of the Zords, like Zordon said-

JASON
-bang pow crunch dead aliens.

KIM
Wait, are you telling me we ALL have giant robots-

ZACK
Yeah it’s a really sick deal-

TRINI
How’re we gonna get back to the Command Center? That’s like eight miles away.

Everyone slowly turns to look at Kim.

INT. KIM’S CAR - SHORTLY THEREAFTER

All of the Rangers are awkwardly packed into Kim’s car, driving in tense silence.

ZACK
SAVIN THE WORLD!

The Rangers immediately all start whooping and celebrating.

INT. THE COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS

Everything in the Command Center is glowing with power; we’ve never seen it fully operational before. Repulsa sits in the command chair (heretofore unoccupied by any of the rangers), while Baboo and Squatt work at the panels.

Zordon’s tube is a web of crackling red electricity, still fueling the scepter, and the entire Command Center.

Squatt and Baboo climb up from below, gibbering excitedly.

GOLDAR
The induction-coils are cycling at full power, we’re ready to begin.

REPULSA
Then do it, quickly, before this idiot dies and we lose power. Activate the goring-magnet!

Squatt cackles and pushes a big lever; there’s a huge rumble.

>EVERY MAJOR CITY

>IN THE WORLD

We jump all over, witnessing minor earthquakes in every city, people being confused and alarmed, what’s going on?

>COMMAND CENTER

Goldar notices something on one of the screens.

GOLDAR
There’s something coming towards the ship...Ha! It’s Zordon’s pets, returned for their master!

REPULSA
I tire of these animals. Send the putties. Destroy them.

EXT. PASTEL CANYON - CONTINUOUS

Kim’s driving, pedal to the medal, Trini sitting shotgun The hundred putties perched all over the fallen T-Rex zord start jumping down, rushing to meet the car.

KIM
You know, it’s a shame. I really liked this car.

.THE CAR SLAMS INTO THE SEA OF PUTTIES, IS IMMEDIATELY BURIED-

>COMMAND CENTER

BABOO
We’re detecting morphs from inside the vehicle!
(notices on the screens)
Power Ranger, sneaking in from the flank!

Indeed, on the screens, we see Zack (the Pink Ranger) moving quickly in from the canyon to the east of the dig, running towards the T-Rex Zord.

REPULSA
They’re trying to get to the Zord!
(laughs)
An ambush, how quaint. Squatt, Scorpina- squash them, now!

Rita waves her hand over a console, hitting it with her dark energies, and Squatt and Scorpina teleport out.

>OUTSIDE

Trini and Kim, morphed, start punching their way out of the pile of putties, glop flying in all directions, as Zack makes a beeline for the Zord-

Squatt teleports in on the deck of the Arcahnastroyer, and lifts it off, cannons firing at Zack-

But Zack’s enhanced athlete reflexes are too much; the Pink Ranger is dodging plasma blasts like they’re offensive tackles, Scorpina can’t get a shot.

ZACK
Bring it! COME ON!

As the Arachnastroyer moves further away, chasing Zack, Scorpina appears, attacking Trini and Kim with the putties-

TRINI
Kim, grab her!

KIM
No problem.

Kim tackles Scorpina as Trini turns and starts one of her epic sprints, rushing through the putties; the putties turn and start chasing her, splitting the group in half...

EXT. PASTEL CANYON - HILLTOP OVERLOOKING THE DIG - CONTINUOUS

Jason, morphed, looks down at the chaos in the canyon.

JASON
Okay, they’re split up. Billy, your move.

INT. THE COMMAND CENTER - INNER CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

Billy activates the teleportation console, and targets the Ranger coins the display.

BILLY
Hold on to your molecules.

INT. THE COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS

Repulsa steps forward, staring at the battle raging on the screens. Her mind is clearly racing, red eyes widening...

REPULSA
Wait...Something- Something’s wrong...

INT. T-REX ZORD - CONTINUOUS

Jason teleports in, not missing a beat, quickly jacking into the damaged systems with his coin; the Zord’s systems flicker, coming back to life-

JASON
I’m online, get everybody in here now!

>COMMAND CENTER

GOLDAR
Teleport detected! A ranger just entered the Red Zord!

REPULSA
It was a trick- there’s one of them here! In the inner-chamber!

>WITH THE RANGERS

We see each Ranger teleported away; Zack escaping the Arcahnastroyer, Trini escaping the putties, and Kim escaping her fight with Scorpina-

>T-REX ZORD

All of the Rangers have been teleported in around Jason.

KIM
Billy get out there now-

INT. THE COMMAND CENTER - INNER CHAMBER

Billy is hurriedly finishing coordinating his own teleport.

BILLY
Almost got it-

GOLDAR SMASHES HIS SWORD THROUGH THE FLOOR OF THE COMMAND CENTER, RIPPING OPEN THE CEILING INNER-CHAMBER!

Billy, hit by the sword as it comes through, falls, decloaking, and Goldar takes another swing with the sword; Billy ducks, scrambles to the console-

And teleports out!

INT. T-REX ZORD

Billy teleports in, and is immediately embraced by the other rangers as the screens all light up.

JASON
Okay. Rise and shine.

EXT. PASTEL CANYON

The T-Rex Zord LURCHES BACK TO LIFE.

>COMMAND CENTER

Repulsa watches in horror as the Zord starts to stand.

REPULSA
Destroy the zord! Destroy it now!

>OUTSIDE

The Arcahnastroyer OPENS FIRE WITH ALL GUNS, eviscerating the T-Rex Zord, scorching the robot!

In the cockpit, the Power Rangers are thrown around as sparks jet out of the damaged machinery.

TRINI
Jason hurry-

JASON
I got it! I got it!

The five coins flash up on the screens all around Jason.

REX ZORD
FULL TEAM DETECTED.
(beat)
INITIATING ZORD RECALL.

>COMMAND CENTER

Dozens of alarms go off simultaneously. Schematics of the zords pop up on all the screens. Baboo squawks in shock.

GOLDAR
(darkly)
Massive teleport inbound.

REPULSA
N- no. That’s impossible.

>OUTSIDE

The Zords teleport in.

Each of them has clearly been buried in an inhospitable environment for thousands of years:

Chunks of glacial ice fall off the Black Mastodon, molten magma drips off the Blue Triceratops, and thousands of pounds of sand pour off the Yellow Sabertooth Tiger.

They are every bit as epic as you’d expect them to be; massive, ancient technology, beautiful and powerful and we’re gonna need to get an incredible production designer because they have to BLOW YOU AWAY.

EXT. THE ARCAHNASTROYER - DECK

Squatt looks at the Zords, horrified.

SQUATT
Uh oh.

INT. T-REX ZORD

The Arcahnastroyer swerves backwards, as the Rangers come up to the shattered window, staring out at their zords in awe.

KIM
Holy shi-

JASON
We’re not done yet. Kim, you’re the elephant, Trini, you’re the cat, and Billy you’re the- one with the- horns, the blue one-

BILLY
The triceratops, it’s called a triceratops-

JASON^
YES I KNOW, THAT, THAT THING, GO NOW!

All the rangers bail, leaping down to to their zords, leaving Zack standing alone next to Jason. He throws up his arms in frustration.

ZACK
Where’s mine? Don’t tell me pink doesn’t even have a zor-

JASON
(watching his screens)
Wait for it...

EXT. ANGEL GROVE - CONTINUOUS

There’s a SONIC BOOM as the massive Pink Pterodactyl Zord swoops low, PUNCHING THROUGH the storm clouds, letting sunlight flood down onto Angel Grove.

All over the city, people are looking up in awe as the Zord flies over, taking out their cameras. The members of the National guard and military stare in numb silence.

Out on the highway, where the main evacuation was going on, the people get out of their cars in the bumper to bumper traffic, staring in awe.

Angela’s hair is blown wildly as the pterodactyl flies over them, zooming towards Pastel Canyon.

INT. T-REX ZORD - CONTINUOUS

In the cockpit, Zack, LEAPS INTO THE AIR.

ZACK
WHAT. WHAT! WHAT NOW. WHAT NOW!?
I GOT THE FLYING ONE! Pink! Pink forever!

>OUTSIDE

The Pterodactyl swoops low, and Zack jumps out, landing on the back of Zord.

>INSIDE THE ZORDS

The rangers plug in to their systems.

JASON (COMM)
Piloting the zords might seem easy but don’t get cocky, it’s feeding on your energy: overexert and you’ll get disoriented. We do this quick, before they-

The Arcahnastroyer opens fire on the T-Rex, knocking it backwards- this is bad-

>COMMAND CENTER

REPULSA
Start stage one of the core-leech, and reroute power to the weapons!

GOLDAR
But Repulsa, shouldn’t we focus on the engines-

REPULSA
I won’t be made a fool of by these insects. Activate the defense cannon. Now.

Goldar complies. The entire Command Center rumbles with energy.

>OUTSIDE

The T-Rex is being brutally bombarded by the Arcahnastroyer.

JASON
A little help here-

THE MASTODON ZORD SLAMS INTO THE Arcahnastroyer, spinning it out as it fires wildly. Kim howls in excitement.

The Arcahnastroyer opens fire on the Mastodon, only to be NAILED by Triceratops from the other side, and then nearly flipped by the Sabertooth tiger, which chomps own on the bow.

ZACK
Hold it still I’ll blast it!

TRINI
I’ve got it- BLAM! A huge blast of purple energy sends the Sabertooth Tiger crashing to the ground.
The Zords turn to see a massive defensive cannon has telescoped out of the Command Center. It opens fire on the Pterodactyl-The Arcahnastroyer begins spraying the zords with fire, pushing them back.

JASON
Crap okay, okay. Zack, get out of range of the cannon, go blow up that thing in the ocean that’s blocking communications. Billy, cover Trini and kill that cannon. Kim, you’re with me, let’s squash the spider.
The Power Rangers yell their approval of this plan.
The Triceratops covers the Tiger in an attack on the cannon, the T-Rex and the Mastodon fight with the Arcahnastroyer, and Zack flies the Pterodactyl out over the bay-
Dives into the water, and BLASTS THE COMMUNICATIONS DISRUPTION DEVICE-

ALL OVER THE

>WORLD

Communications come BACK ON. From the War-Room at the Pentagon to the control center of CNN to teens checking their cell phones, SIGNAL IS RESTORED.

ANGEL GROVE
The Tiger tears apart the cannon, and the T-Rex is able to RIP THE ARACHNASTROYER IN HALF. The four Zords turn to the Command Center. In the Zords, all of the Rangers are sweating and a little beat down; operating the Zords messes you up.

COMMAND CENTER
Rita screams in frustration.

GOLDAR
Activate phase two of the core leech!
Goldar does as he’s told.

GOLDAR
What of the Rangers?

REPULSA
They’ve earned a more violent death.
(beat)
Are you ready?

Goldar grins widely, cracking his neck.

GOLDAR
Always.

Repulsa storms down to her scepter, and rips it free of the console it was imbedded in, turning it and BLASTING GOLDAR.

REPULSA
This charade ends now. Kill them all!

Goldar GLOWS WITH ENERGY, and rapidly begins growing!

GOLDAR
As you wish.

She waves her Scepter, and he’s teleported out in a storm of crackling dark energy.

>OUTSIDE

TRINI
Hey- hey I’m getting some weird readings over here-

KIM
Um. Guys? It’s- that guy!

JASON
What do you-

The Zords turn to see GOLDAR CHARGING AT THEM.

Goldar now stands nearly 300 feet tall, easily bigger than all of the Zords- his thunderous footsteps shake the ground-

JASON
...That’s a big dude-

GOLDAR STARTS ANNIHILATING THE DINOZORDS. It’s incredibly brutal; he’s just beating the crap out of them, faster, stronger, and infinitely more skilled in combat than the teenagers in their clunky ancient robots.

GOLDAR
You fight hard, but you’re still just children of an inferior species, using weapons you couldn’t hope to understand!

Pieces of the Dinozords start getting badly damaged, and the rangers are violently thrown around in their cockpits, scary, car crash impacts-

He even leaps into the air to grab the Pterodactyl, and SLAM DUNKS it into the side of the mountain, CRASH!

Goldar gets the T-Rex Zord in a headlock, and begins to wrench the already damaged neck- oh god he’s going to RIP ITS HEAD CLEAN OFF-

Inside, Jason howls in pain and exertion as sparks and fire shoot everywhere.

GOLDAR
You efforts are noble, but you could never have won this battle. Even now, I can smell feel your puny human brain frying in your skull.

Jason focuses, closing his eyes- the psionic input is overwhelming- Goldar’s right, it’s FRYING HIS BRAIN and we see his frazzled thoughts, bright and burning with static, like distorted old home movies-

Flashes of his dad yelling at him- him riding in the front seat of the cop car as a little boy- young Billy in his glasses showing Jason a book- Trini winning a track meet-young Zack hiking in the woods- young Kim playing on stage with a band-

FIVE COLORS FLASH and we see ELTARIAN HIEROGLYPHICS START RAPIDLY SCROLLING-

Jason’s eyes pop wide open as the wave of energy hits him.

Jason’s displays go from red to a new, multi-colored mode: blue, yellow, red, pink and black.

GOLDAR
(smiles)
Not anyone can be Power Rangers.

JASON
(beat)
We know.

There’s a HUGE BLAST OF RED ELECTRICITY that knocks Goldar flat on his back, dazed.

JASON
EVERYBODY HOLD ON TIGHT.

>COMMAND CENTER

Rita stares at the screens, mouth agape as all the Zords are drawn together with crackling, thunderous waves of pure energy.

REPULSA
This- This Is impossible. They’re MONKEYS. THEY’RE JUST MONKEYS!

The soundtrack rips into ratcheting guitars. I know this music. You know this music. Oh yes. It’s time.

>CUE: POWER

>RANGERS THEME

In a symphony of churning, crashing steel, servos and pistons that haven’t seen action in 20,000 years, the massive robots interlock and combine, forming a majestic, archetypal warrior sixty meters tall and weighing in excess of 570 tons.

It’s THE MEGAZORD.

>THE MEGAZORD

All of the rangers, still dazed, find themselves on the bridge of the Megazord; it’s still tight quarters, but they’re looking out at an incredible view.

The Rangers are bruised and bleeding from the fight with Goldar; they all seem a little loopy and out of it.

BILLY
Jason...we did it. This is the Megazord.

JASON
(playing it so cool)
...WHATEVER.

>OUTSIDE

Goldar is attacking- WHAM, the Megazord PUNCHES HIM IN THE FACE, sending him tumbling down the side of the canyon.

>MEGAZORD

The Rangers EXPLODE INTO CELEBRATION OF JASON.

>COMMAND CENTER

Zordon, a flickering, weak face in the tube, groans in pain.

ZORDON
(weakly)
They’re going to beat you, Rita.

REPULSA
Shut up and die, old man!

ZORDON
I know they’re going to beat you.
(laughs weakly)
Because I told them they couldn’t do it.

Repulsa falters, and then her face contorts into a horrible smile.

REPULSA
GOLDAR! Attack the city. Destroy ...everything.
(to Baboo)
Initiate the final core leech! GUT THIS WRETCHED PLANET!

>OUTSIDE

Goldar turns and starts running towards downtown Angel Grove.

JASON
Don’t let him get to the city!

KIM
It’s okay, I think I can-

The Megazord launches into the air on dozens of tiny rockets-

>ANGEL GROVE

People stand on and in the city’s few skyscrapers; they’ve been twenty four hours without communication, they’ve just witnessed some kind of alien mayhem happening in the hills outside the city, and-

-now there’s a GIANT MONSTER, RUNNING STRAIGHT TOWARDS THEM-

People take each other’s hands, lovers embrace, we see almost every character we’ve met in the film getting ready-

.THE MEGAZORD LANDS ON TOP OF GOLDAR, TACKLING HIM, WHAM!

Windows shatter, car alarms go off, but everyone in the city is completely rapt-

Goldar falls, and the Megazord starts to stand, but then staggers, tripping on its own feet coming crashing down on a colorful building.

INT. MEGAZORD - CONTINUOUS

All the of the Power Rangers focus, shaking off the cobwebs from the fall.

TRINI
Focus, we have to work together.

ZACK
We crushed the Wiggy Woggle Arcade!

BILLY
Oh no!

JASON^
Awesome!

KIM
What the hell is the Wiggy Wog-

There’s a huge ROAR-

EXT. ANGEL GROVE - CONTINUOUS

Goldar go crashing into a huge electrical transformer-outcropping, causing dozens of explosions!

INT. MILITARY SITUATION ROOM

The military situation room is high tech, filled with high ranking officers. A tech is on a video-chat with the Sergeant we saw earlier.

He hurriedly waves down a high ranking officer.

TECH
Something’s going on in Angel Grove.
(to the video)
Repeat, did you say a robot?

EXT. ANGEL GROVE - CONTINUOUS

Goldar and the Megazord exchange blows, and the Megazord downs him yet again! A recovering Goldar draws his sword and SLASHES THE MEGAZORD ACROSS THE CHEST, knocking it backwards.

The Sergeant is on the roof of a parking garage with a military communications truck, the building rumbling from the giant battle.

SERGEANT
Sir yes sir, a big blue monkey knight is fighting a giant five color robot sir! Things here are very dangerous! Very- very strange, and very dangerous!

>COMMAND CENTER

There’s a pulse of energy, and we see that the core-leech is starting! Holograms show a magnet drawing energy from the center of the Earth!

REPULSA
Yes! Ahahahahaha!

>MEGAZORD

The ground rumbles; an even bigger earthquake as the Megazord struggles to its feet.

BILLY
That’s the core-leech, they’re going to destroy the planet!

ZACK
Attacking the city was just a distraction!

TRINI
I think I have access to teleporters on this thing...

JASON
Someone has to go back and stop the core leech.

BILLY
I- I’ll go.

JASON
(smiling)
You’re volunteering?

BILLY
I’m the only one who knows how to use the Command Center systems.

KIM
I’ll go too.

BILLY
Kim, Repulsa-

KIM
You really wanna get in my way?

Billy laughs, then looks at Jason for a second.

JASON
Go save the world.

They share a moment, and then- flash! flash! Billy and Kim are gone.

Goldar attacks! The Megazord blocks his sword blow just barely- the hit shatters the cockpit- and Goldar attacks again, BURYING HIS SWORD IN THE MEGAZORD’S SHOULDER!

Everything begins sparking and glitching in the cockpit-

TRINI
Something’s wrong with the left arm-

JASON
Yeah we’re getting our ass kicked-

ZACK
No, look.

We see a scan of the exterior of the Megazord; Scorpina has crawled up into the workings of the giant robot, and is wreaking havoc, ripping up machinery!

Zack stares at the warning lights on his console. The destruction outside. Goldar coming again. Everything goes quiet. He’s freezing.

JASON
Zack, you with me?

Zack looks up at Jason, and suddenly unhooks from his console.

ZACK
I got it. She’s mine.

JASON
(beat)
Zack, if you don’t get her off the Megazord we lose this fight...

Zack’s quiet, understanding the pressure, looking at Jason.

JASON
You’re right. You’ve got this.

Zack, under his helmet, smiles brightly- then all business.

He takes a running start and dives out the cracked cockpit-

>ON THE MEGAZORD

Zack runs down the chest of the Megazord, spots Scorpina tearing at machinery in the shoulder, and switches direction, leaping and free-climbing the surface of the massive robot hundreds of feet above the ground-

He dives- AND TACKLES SCORPINA-

INT. THE COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS

There’s clearly some kind of countdown going on, on a hologram in the middle of the room.

Billy suddenly uncloaks next to Baboo, SLAMMING HIM FACE FIRST INTO THE CONSOLE!

REPULSA
You!

She charges- AND IS TACKLED BY KIM, FORCING HER TO DROP HER SCEPTER- but then Rita VIOLENTLY FLINGS HER OFF!

SMASHING INTO ZORDON’S TUBE SO HARD IT CRACKS. Billy rushes to Kim, protective.

BILLY
Kim!

KIM
I’m..ow...I’m okay...

Repulsa ROUNDS ON THEM. It’s TERRIFYING. She is a MONSTER.

REPULSA
You’re like flies, buzzing around my face! It’s time you were swatted-

Repulsa reaches for her scepter, and Kim kicks away her claw.

KIM
Billy, shut down the machine.

BILLY
Don’t let her get the scepter.

Billy begins frantically working the controls, as Kim confronts Repulsa, her suit popping out extra spikes.

REPULSA
Your armor is...vicious. You’d do well in the Dominators. Lord Zedd could make you a Queen; give you your own planet.

KIM
I’m already Queen of this planet.

Repulsa hisses, laughing.

REPULSA
You know...Black was my old coin.

KIM
Yeah? Well you can have it back, when I shove it up your-

Repulsa ATTACKS- fighting Rita Repulsa is serious business, and she starts knocking Kim around like a RAG DOLL, recklessly trashing the Command Center!

>MEGAZORD

Goldar is SMASHING THE MEGAZORD, pushing it back towards the city! Jason’s nose is bleeding, he’s sweaty and dazed.

JASON
There’s a sword function- but I’m already too messed up- I can’t fight anymore- Trini, you have to take over.

TRINI
What? No!

JASON
I’m switching over to you. You’re more focused than I am, you always have been. You can do this-

TRINI
That’s like- school, that’s not ROBOTS-

They’re HIT AGAIN, TUMBLING THEM BACKWARDS!

JASON
TRINI IF YOU DON’T DO THIS RIGHT NOW THERE WILL BE NO SCHOOL. THERE WILL BE NO DEBATE TEAM, THERE WILL BE NO AP CALCULUS, THERE WILL BE NO TRACK, AND YOU WILL NOT BE VALEDICTORIAN. I don’t love you because you’re “good” at things, I love you because you’re THE BEST.
(beat)
Now cut loose and KICK HIS ASS.

OUTSIDE

Goldar strides towards them, wiping orange blood off his face as another earthquake rocks Angel Grove!

GOLDAR
YOUR WORLD ENDS AROUND YOU!

Goldar charges, swinging in his sword-

INSIDE

Trini stares at the complicated controls.

TRINI
I...You’re right.
(beat)
I’m the best.

She grabs the controls, her suit locking into them-

OUTSIDE

The Megazord EXTENDS OUT ITS SWORD, blocking Goldar at the last second! Goldar roars in frustration, and begins an epic sword duel with the Megazord as

OUTSIDE

ZACK
Don’t run from me! This is my time!

Zack is chasing Scorpina from place to place on the Megazord, performing amazing jumps and dives as he fights her on the every shifting surface of the giant robot-

>COMMAND CENTER

Repulsa, fighting with Kim, slashes her down and flings her aside, and then turns to see that Billy’s no longer at the console, and her scepter is gone.

She hisses in anger, and slowly stalks forward, looking around. She spots her scepter on the other side of the Command Center.

REPULSA
Think you can HIDE FROM ME, COWARD?

BILLY
Why would I hide from you, loser?

BEHIND YOU, REPULSA- Billy ATTACKS HER FULL ON, his suit’s dazzling barrage of defensive projectiles knocking her to the edge of the Command Center...

!...But Repulsa recovers, smacking him backwards-

ALPHA 5
HI RITA!

Too close to the edge! ALPHA FIVE’S HEAD HELD ON, and it GRABS ON TO REPULSA AND STARTS ELECTROCUTING HER, as BOTH RANGERS ATTACK!

Baboo, seeing an opportunity to escape, teleports himself away.

>MEGAZORD

Goldar roars with now very familiar frustration and begins brutally hacking at the Megazord-

-but Trini swings the sword to block every attack!

JASON
YEAH! HELL YEAH! BRING IT ON! MY GIRLFRIEND IS KICKING YOUR-

TRINI
I’m CONCENTRATING.

JASON
-Oh sorry yeah-

Goldar tries a big swing, and Trini catches it, sending them both staggering backwards, towards the pier.

JASON
Trini, the Wonder Wheel!

Trini, seeing the Ferris Wheel behind them, GRABS GOLDAR AND DRIVES HIM THROUGH IT, tangling him in the metal architecture-THEY BOTH FALL INTO THE BAY-

>OUTSIDE

Zack struggles to hold on, Scorpina still attacking, as they’re plunged UNDERWATER-

>MEGAZORD

The wall of water floods into the cockpit, but Trini and Jason hang on...

JASON
This is it. When we come up. This is it.

>OUTSIDE

Both of the giants surface, swords raised, Goldar still tangled in the Ferris Wheel-

On the Megazord, Scorpina tackles Zack down, mauling him viciously, ripping apart his helmet and hissing in his face.

Zack smiles, and smooches at her. Scorpina is confused.

ZACK
See, you got stuck thinking about the little fight. But me? I was thinking about the big fight.

Scorpina looks up, realizing they’re on the edge of the Megazord’s sword blade, JUST AS IT SWINGS IN TOWARDS GOLDAR’S CHEST FOR THE FINAL BLOW-

ZACK
Touchdown.

Zack embeds her stinger in the machinery, and rolls off, tumbling hundreds of feet down into the ocean and Scorpina SHRIEKS as-

BOOM! The Megazord IMPALES GOLDAR! The crackling energy of sword causes him to EXPLODE IN A BURST OF PURE ATOMIC LIGHT AND HEAT!

>COMMAND CENTER

Rita strikes down Kim, throws Alpha 5 like a frisbee, and bashes away Billy- both of their armors are torn to pieces.

Repulsa raises a hand, and with no one to stop her, the scepter is sucked to her hand.

REPULSA
You idiots almost won. But it’s over now. Finally over.

Everything begins glowing in the Command Center- THE FINAL CORE LEECH IS STARTING, THE HOLOGRAMS SHOWING THE EARTH IMPLODING-

The Earthquakes are slowly building-

REPULSA
(exhausted and vicious)
All that’s left to do is spark the ignition. Like I’ve always said: IF YOU WANT SOMETHING DONE RIGHT-

Repulsa goes to plant her scepter into the console, back into the console-

BILLY
NO!

Billy SHOVES HIMSELF BETWEEN THE SCEPTER AND THE CONSOLE- oh god OUCH PURPLE ELECTRICITY TEARING HIM APART, it’s the end of Return of the Jedi! His armor is bursting apart at the seams and then-

The console is struck and destroyed! The destructive power surge OVERLOADS the systems, shutting them down! All of the core-leech systems crash! The ship is powering down!

REPULSA
NO! What have you done, you’ve ruined it, you’ve ruined everything!

Kim hurls her own body over Billy’s, protectively, and Repulsa BLASTS THEM BOTH WHEN-

The roof of the Command Center is PEELED OFF in a shower of destruction and debris. Repulsa looks up...

To see the Megazord looming over her, its massive sword pointed directly at her face.

There’s no denying it. She’s lost.

Repulsa SCREAMS a noise of pure rage, and then POOF! She’s teleported out in a blast of green smoke.

EXT. THE MOONBASE - CONTINUOUS

The Dominator’s Moonbase is clearly just the wreckage they were trapped in, with some still functional equipment.

Repulsa snaps in, dazed, to see Baboo and Squatt looming over her. It’s clear they teleported her out.

Baboo steps forward, and with some effort, speaks.

BABOO
We teleported you out. The battle was lost...FOR NOW. FOR NOW, my queen.

Squatt and Baboo whimper as Rita, clearly furious, bristles.

BABOO
Repulsa, I hope you understand that this was not an act of cowardice...Live to fight another day, and all that?

Squatt makes burpy noises of agreement. She smacks them both down, and then looks up at the Earth hanging high in the starry sky above her.

Repulsa unleashes a bone-chilling scream of hatred.

EXT. THE COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS

The Megazord stumbles backwards, drunkenly. Inside, we can see that Jason is nearly unconscious and Trini is dripping with sweat, her noise bleeding badly, both of them out of it.

>ON A NEARBY HILL

Trini’s parents, Michael and Ellen, slowly wake up from their knocked out state. They see the messed up city in the distance. They see the Megazord.

MICHAEL KWAN
Ellen...we missed something.

>COMMAND CENTER

Zordon urgently drags himself out of his cracked tube, looking pale and deathly.

ZORDON
Alpha, recall all rangers, cloak the Command Center and send the Zords back to their holding points, now!

The dented Alpha 5 hops up on a console and-

>OUTSIDE

The Megazord TOPPLES OVER- and then vanishes in five separate bursts of light-

EXT. PASTEL CANYON - CONTINUOUS

The Command Center ripples and vanishes.

INT. THE COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS

All five rangers are now home. And they are MESSED UP.

Everyone lays there exhausted on the floor, in pain, nearly unconscious.

Kim lays staring up through the giant rip in the roof; we see military jets zip by.

KIM
(dazed)
It’s like...a pterodactyl, a woolly mammoth, a T-Rex, a triceratops and a sabertooth tiger?...
(beat)
What is that...that’s so random...

Kim sits up, slowly, and sees Trini, nose bleeding badly, and goes to her, helping her up. Zack coughs out some water, and turns to see Jason, slumped against a wrecked console.

They push themselves up, and pick up Billy, who’s easily the most physically beaten.

Zordon, laying across a console, slowly flips over. His voice crackles over the damaged Command Center speakers.

ZORDON
(beat)
How did you plan all that?

JASON
Zordon, I have to be real with you here...After the first part, we were kinda...we were kinda winging it...

All the Rangers murmur in self-conscious agreement.

Zordon, Zack, Billy, Kim, Trini and Jason look out of the massive rip in the Command Center.

They can see all manner of emergency lights heading into the smoking decimation caused by their battle...but the city looks mostly intact.

Helicopters are approaching from all directions. The military jets are making low passes on the wreckage of Goldar’s armor.

ZORDON
((beat)
This isn’t over. You’ll have to keep this secret, or other humans will try to take this technology and use it for themselves. Repulsa won’t give up; she’ll keep trying to get parts of her ship, even without her most powerful soldiers. I’m stranded here, and there are other, darker forces in the universe who will come looking for you, now...

BILLY
Zordon, are we safe. I mean...Right now. Did we win?

ZORDON
I-

Zordon looks at the kids, all beaten to crap, armors barely functional.

ZORDON
For now, Earth is safe. The Zords are hidden, repairing themselves. And that ten seconds of core-mining is enough to keep the Command Center cloaked and operational for fifty years.
(beat, then quietly)
...You won.

ZACK
...Hey, we did...WE WON! HEY GUYS HOLY SHIT WE SAVED THE EARTH!

Kim grabs Billy and kisses him. Jason squeezes Trini’s hand tightly, supporting her. She’s still dazed.

Zack rushes Jason and hugs him, and the Power Rangers celebrate in manic, unbridled disbelief, embracing and yelling like a victorious sports team, reunited as what they had been all along:

Old friends.

Zordon watches them celebrate, and we can feel him missing his own team...And his pride in his new one.

With Kim and Billy and Jason and Trini having paired off, it leaves Zack to be immediately hugged by Alpha 5.

ALPHA 5
HURRAY FRIENDS!

ZACK
Yeah I, uh...I have a girlfriend too actually, I just...She’s not a Power Ranger, you know how it is.

ALPHA 5
YES! I AM SURE YOUR GIRLFRIEND IS REAL!

ZACK
Don’t be a dick.

SLAM TO:

News reports. Dozens of them, first local, then national, then international, Anderson Cooper, the Daily Show, everything. It’s all about the World Wide communications black out, and the incident in Angel Grove.

NEWSCASTER
Who are the “Power Rangers?”

We see all the theories: alien conquerors! Ancient humans!

Secret government programs! Jason’s dad is being interviewed by a field reporter?

JASON
I don’t know. From what I’ve seen...We’re in good hands.

>SLAM TO BLACK.

INT. HARVARD CLASSROOM - NIGHT

Trini is sitting in the crowded class, looking at the snow fall outside the window. She finishes her test, and then goes down the aisle, turning it in. She heads out into the

>HALLWAY

Hurrying up towards the ladies’ room. As Trini walks towards the bathroom, she lifts her shirt up over her head to reveal a bikini- a flash as she goes through the door and-

>TELEPORTS TO

EXT. ANGEL GROVE LAKE - AFTERNOON

We’re up in the hills outside of Angel Grove, by a beautiful little cabin. Without missing a beat Trini finishes undressing as she runs down a dock and leaps into the water-

-coming up right next to Jason.

JASON
How was your final?

TRINI
You don’t care.

JASON^
I don’t care.

They kiss. Up by the cabin, Zack is working the barbeque, while Angela sits and watches him.

ZACK
Why are you giving me that face?

ANGELA
When do I get a power coin?

ZACK
I thought part of the deal of you knowing was you didn’t bug me about it.

Angela makes a face.

ZACK
...You want one? You can have the purple one.

ANGELA
What! FOR REAL-

ZACK
Nah there’s no purple one.

Angela slaps him in the back of the head as he laughs.

ANGELA
Screw you super hero, I’m getting a veggie burger.

Angela goes inside. On a hammock, Kim is laying across Billy, watching Jason and Trini approach, holding hands.

KIM
If I ever get that PG-13, promise to put me out of my misery?

BILLY
Why would I do that, you love your misery.

Kim snort-laughs, and then blushes, self conscious.

All of the Rangers’ coins let out the distinctive beeping tone. The teens perk up, suddenly solemn and serious.

ZORDON (ON COMM)
Rangers. Repulsa is attempting to retrieve another buried portion of her wrecked mothership outside of Tokyo, Japan.

BILLY
We’re on it, Zordon. No problem.

TRINI
Guess I’m gonna be late to class.

ZACK
Kim, you down to trade coins?

KIM
...I’ll think about it.

ZACK
Mine can fly.

KIM
It’s still pink.

JASON
All right guys. It’s morphin’ time!

The teens raise their coins, and VANISH IN A FIVE COLOR FLASH OF LIGHT!

Angela exits the cabin.

ANGELA
Hey guys we’re out of-
(looks around, frustrated)
HEY. NOT. COOL.

>SLAM TO BLACK.

INT. BONESHIP - FAR SIDE OF THE UNIVERSE

FINSTER, a ghoulish creature best described as a cross between a bat and a pig, grovels his way into the command room of The Bone Ship, a spaceship seemingly made entirely of obsidian black bone and gooey red flesh.

He approaches a throne, and addresses the huge figure that sits upon it, facing out into space.

FINSTER
Lord Zedd. We have news.
(beat)
Power Rangers.

ZEDD
Impossible.

FINSTER
...We’ve received a message from Rita Repulsa....

ZEDD
...Repulsa?

Zedd turns, revealing his true form; a massive humanoid cyclops of inflamed, veiny, skinless muscle, barely contained by a steel exoskeleton! Yikes!

FINSTER
Yes, my liege.
(beat, nervous)
Zordon lives.

Zedd stands, letting out a low, guttural growl. He raises a steel-clawed hand, opening it to reveal a nasty looking piece of technology, rotating and oscillating....What is that?

ZEDD
Zordon...dies.

Emerald arcs of electricity pour off of it. Oh my god...

It’s a Green Power Coin.
